"37m with a 3yo child, have to disagree. Cost of living is not a barrier. In fact, having kids in Singapore costs less than having a child in other developed countries. 

 My family is a medium income family and we have no issues financially. The cost of children among the young adults is the perception of it due to ignorance. How many young adults know it costs you nothing from your pocket for your child's delivery and during and after pregnancy care? Even when you go private it costs you almost nothing? In 2021, my wife delivered our baby in a private hospital. We booked the most expensive package at Thompson and it only cost me $3k from our own money. In contrast, my home vacuum cleaner cost me $3.5k. I know the costs have gone up, but so is the payout. After three years, my child's CDA still have money left which we use whenever she gets sick or for dental. 

After that initial cost, having a child costs me around $300 a month (food, toys, clothes etc). Add nursery, around $900 a month. Once she is in school, then the cost will come down again to around $500 a month. If you're in a earning category who can't afford $500 a month, there are government programmes to help your child. Keeping that in mind, look out the windows at night and see how many cars are parked there. Each one costs around 2k a month or more. And at least in my HDB area, almost every car park is full at night. If you can afford a car, you can afford to have at least two children instead. And ten years later, you'll still have something left. It's a conscious choice to go for the car. And trying to find kids to play with my kid around our blocks, I believe there's way more cars than kids. 

The cost of living is just ignorance or just a convenient excuse. Or it's a lifestyle choice. In any case, those who want to have kids will have kids and continue on while those who don't get removed from the gene pool. There's no right or wrong to it as we are all free adults. But waiting on politicians to bring you utopia before having kids is not the right thing if you 'want' to have kids.",yo child disagree cost living barrier fact kid cost less child developed country family medium income family issue financially cost child among young adult perception due ignorance many young adult know cost nothing pocket child delivery pregnancy care even go private cost almost nothing wife delivered baby private hospital booked expensive package thompson cost k money contrast home vacuum cleaner cost k know cost gone payout three year child cda still money left use whenever get sick dental initial cost child cost around month food toy clothes etc add nursery around month school cost come around month youre earning category cant afford month government programme help child keeping mind look window night see many car parked cost around k month least hdb area almost every car park full night afford car afford least two child instead ten year later youll still something left conscious choice go car trying find kid play kid around block believe there way car kid cost living ignorance convenient excuse lifestyle choice case want kid kid continue dont removed gene pool there right wrong free adult waiting politician bring utopia kid right thing want kid,Neutral,0.6091831922531128

"I’m in my early 30s, and many of my peers earn above the median salary. For us, the cost of living isn’t the sole issue when it comes to having children. It’s more about the lifestyle and priorities we’ve chosen.

We grew up without the chance to truly enjoy life, so now that we’re financially independent, we want to use our hard-earned money to experience life—traveling, pursuing hobbies, and simply enjoying freedom. For those who genuinely want children, they’ll find a way to have them, regardless of financial constraints.

Even if the government subsidized 50% of the costs, I’d still choose not to have a child. Raising a child is exhausting, and it leaves little room for personal pursuits. Reducing working hours wouldn’t help much either—free time would still be spent taking care of the child, not on personal growth or leisure. Traveling becomes more stressful than enjoyable when you have a child.

Hiring a helper might ease some of the burden, but it creates another issue—if the helper takes over most of the parenting responsibilities, then what’s the point? It feels like the essence of parenthood gets lost.

"Medium income family means roughly 11k household income? Bit hard to gauge without actual income numbers. I would also think that’s feasible for an average family (11k per month) quoting your monthly expenditures. In terms of base cost, the minimum is definitely what you have said.

Take your end work at 5pm as an example. Why is it so prevalent that our 9-5 is actually 9-6? It's the companies that want a 9-6 working hours, presumably for competitiveness.


Another example is the vehicles on the road. Drivers kanchiong because they are short on time. This is in stark contrast with other countries. I've been to Japan recently and the drivers there really give way to pedestrians, with the same situation here we would see our drivers rushing 99% of the time. Rural areas or in Tokyo, the drivers give way, they don't rush.


Another example is the people here being impatient with staff, because of this kanchiong culture.


These are the examples that I have witnessed with my own two eyes.

"it's literally just, ""Hey what if we did anonymous surveys, but like, for real?"" Kinda sad.

>Using an AI interviewing platform developed by US-based tech startup Listen Labs ([listenlabs.ai](https://listenlabs.ai/)), participants can share their candid opinions without social pressure or fear of judgment from a human interviewer, resulting in an unprecedented depth of authentic insights.  
  
Key findings from the study indicate that financial concerns are the top barrier to having children, with 70 per cent of respondents citing the high cost of living and the financial demands of raising a family in Singapore.              
  
**Mr James Breeze, CEO of Research Network,** said their innovative use of AI in research has demonstrated how researchers can conduct their studies rapidly, generating actionable findings within weeks, rather than several months with conventional telephone or face-to-face interviews.  
  
Prof Calvert added that using such an AI platform may eliminate social desirability bias, typically present in face-to-face interviews, where interviewees subconsciously reply in a manner they think would be more suitable or preferable by the interviewer.  
  
In contrast, having an AI ask questions using neutral sentences presented as text on a web app, and participants speaking in response, allows for a mirror-like experience where respondents feel more comfortable expressing their true feelings, similar to talking to themselves. ",literally hey anonymous survey real kinda sad using ai interviewing platform developed usbased tech startup listen lab listenlabsai participant share candid opinion without social pressure fear judgment human interviewer resulting unprecedented depth authentic insight key finding study indicate financial concern top barrier child per cent respondent citing high cost living financial demand raising family mr james breeze ceo research network said innovative use ai research demonstrated researcher conduct study rapidly generating actionable finding within week rather several month conventional telephone facetoface interview prof calvert added using ai platform may eliminate social desirability bias typically present facetoface interview interviewee subconsciously reply manner think suitable preferable interviewer contrast ai ask question using neutral sentence presented text web app participant speaking response allows mirrorlike experience respondent feel comfortable expressing true feeling similar talking,Neutral,0.8986375331878662

"If its all about money, that still doesn't explain why countries with significantly less wealth, less income, and higher proportion of their income being spent on daily necessities in the current day have larger families. On top of that, you then have to explain why countries that have the best financial supports in the world for families and children still don't see significant boosts in birth rates. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Germany - None of these countries have birthrates reasonably close to the replacement rate. You simply can't do it with money, certainly not within a reasonable frame of reference.

With regards to your study, the biggest issue you have to wrap your head around is that the proportion of higher income families being represented in families having any children does NOT indicate higher incomes reach replacement rates. [Not to mention that this data is contradicted by other sources that show higher income earners having lower replacement rates than lower income earners in South Korea](https://www.kedglobal.com/culture-trends/newsView/ked202304180006). Even if this was somehow magically the case, you have to ask yourself if it even makes sense that an entire country can consist of household incomes above 300k purely to sustain birthrates (or alternatively, providing supports that represent up to 200-300k per year per family). At that point, the solution is clearly not more money, but something else.

"I'm not paid ridiculously. My total income would not exceed 7k a month. My wife doesn't earn much these days as she only works part time. She won't go full time until our kid in primary 1 at least. And I'm not sure if you'd rate my family frugal but this is how we live. My wife cooks most of our meals in my work days, and I cook during our off days. We both can cook rather well. We eat a balanced, varied diet and a lot of fruits. And we don't eat much processed foods. We only give organic food for the kid until she is at least 4 because we can afford it and to give her body enough time to develop. My daughter has her own common room for her toys, a room for her to sleep, and a room where my wife and I sleep.her play room is now stuffed full of toys.We are in the process of secretly removing older toys and donating them to make more space. She has 3 bicycles and one scooter. She has an entire floor to ceiling shelf full of children's books. She has a different table with three drawers full of arts and craft things which include painting stuff as well. We do go out to eat for special occasions but would rather prefer we cook ourselves because more often than not, we are disappointed by the food offered owing to our skill at cooking. It's a problem faced by people who can cook well. But we still do go out. We just started traveling overseas for holidays as now she is big enough to actually enjoy and learn. We will travel overseas twice a year for 10 days each trip. Every week, we go out to a new park in Singapore. And once a month we go to a place like the Zoo, bird park, Museum etc for the benefit of her and us as we enjoy them too. Every single day we take her out to play for at least two hours. If it isn't raining, then we play outdoors, if it is raining, then we play under the block. At home, my wife will sit down with the baby to do painting, arts and craft and learn the alphabet, counting etc for an hour or two (depending on her attention span). 

How do we afford to do all that? I don't know if we are special. I don't think or feel we are. I worked for 10 years (RP graduated) before we had our child and my wife worked for 5 years (NTU graduated). We first paid off all our debt except the mortgage which is serviced wholly by CPF contributions. My wife and I both never had any habit of buying luxury goods. For us, a converse bag for $50 is good enough. A good cotton on or Uniqlo tshirt for $20 is good enough. Everything we save at the end of the month, (and no, we don't count pennies whenever we buy something), we invest in shares. Sometimes we buy just 1 share. Sometimes we buy 10. We don't keep money in banks or in gold jewelry. My wife and I both hate wearing gold. Apart from our wedding rings, we don't wear any other form of jewellery. So our expenses there are zero. I do buy flowers for my wife once or twice a month if I see the flowers she likes. 

On top of that, I decided not to jump from job to job every few years. So I worked at the same company, the same department for the last 13 years. Owing to that, I managed to cultivate enough social connections that I can take a longer lunch break which I can spend with my family. I also bought the house right next to where my workplace is. So it's only a 10 min walk from work to home. I can also take time offs, easily take MCs and family care leaves with no questions asked as I am one of the most senior employees at work. Sure, I would have made another $1k, $2k more if I jumped around but I'd trade that for this freedom. 

I don't know if rest of the Singapore would rate us poor. And I don't really care. We never worry about money. We never look at a toy our baby wants and drag her away because we can't afford it. We never pick up a fruit and put it back down because we can't afford it.

The first time I read this, I thought it was $21000 annual income, in which case it would be true that more money = more children. But it's not.

>We find a U-shaped relationship between the two and the bottom of the U is reached when the household income is around S$21,000. This is consistent with the cross-country results in Myrskyla et al. (2009),who show that when the level of development of a country exceeds a certain threshold the fertility decline is reversed. However, there is a catch. The current median income in Singapore is roughly around S$5,500. It is just one-quarter of the threshold level of household income that our study identifies for fertility reversal. In other words, in the case of Singapore, the effect of higher income is likely to be negative on fertility for quite some time in the future.

"Well said on the kancheong kiasu mentality everywhere. 

About 9 - 6 for extra competitiveness, it only sounds and looks good on paper. Employees are humans after all and humans can get tired. Even with that 1 extra hour in office, it will really translate to more things done and more true productivity? Most times, people start to lose focus, get tired and just mentally zone out by 4pm++ at the latest, after that, it's just about scrolling phone, going toilet really slowly, waiting to go back. So it's really a big waste of a lot of people's time and lives here. Time that can be put to better use - like going for a workout or running errands or heading back to prep dinner etc. Intangible benefits that will actually improve yourself and your loved ones in the long run. And not just being an unseen cog fulfilling some weird robotic man-made requirement to stay ""competitive"". 

If an employee is truly productive, he/she can do that same task in lesser time. The problem here is show-face culture > actual tasks done. Work should be about clearing tasks, not clocking hours serving time at a desk, that's just plain dumb. But I guess management cannot wrap their heads around it, they like to see people sitting at their desks and will lose their marbles collectively if people can clear their work and ready to leave by early afternoon. 

Things are not that urgent for most jobs, you are not saving lives, most likely you are just replying emails and filling in excel sheets. People need that bigger perspective to chill out a little and live life a little. You only live once leh...

GST hike did not ‘turbocharge’ inflation, says PM Wong as he acknowledged cost of living concerns

SINGAPORE - The GST increase did not lead to a “turbocharging” of inflation, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that price increases moderated after the tax rate was raised in 2023 and 2024.

PM Wong was responding to Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh, who questioned during the Budget debate why the Government had gone ahead to raise the goods and services tax, “thereby turbocharging inflation further”.

Inflation was driven primarily by global factors - war, supply chain disruptions and rising energy costs - and has since eased globally and in Singapore, the prime minister said on Feb 28.

He added that the Singapore’s central bank assessed the GST increase to have a “transitory” impact on inflation. The tax rate was raised from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in two stages, in 2023 and 2024.

Inflation peaked in 2022 at 6.1 per cent, he said. It moderated in 2023 to 4.8 per cent, before coming down further in 2024 to 2.4 per cent.

“Where is the turbocharging?” PM Wong said. “Look, I know elections are approaching, but this chamber is not an election rally. Let’s not get carried away by hyperbole and have a debate based on facts.”

The fact is that inflation has eased both globally and in Singapore, said PM Wong in his speech to round up the three-day debate on Budget 2025, which saw 57 MPs raise their concerns and suggestions.

The Finance Minister acknowledged that people are still concerned about cost pressures, and that it takes time to adjust to new price realities.

This concern is not unique to Singapore as it is felt across many other advanced economies where the headline economic indicators are positive but sentiments are poor, he added.

“We understand these concerns, and that’s why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures,” he said. These include more CDC vouchers and the voucher component in the SG60 package.

“We will continue to provide cost of living support for as long as needed, and within our means,” added PM Wong.

Addressing points raised by Workers’ Party and Progress Singapore Party (PSP) MPs, PM Wong said they “appear to be unhappy and displeased” that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with cost of living.

“They suggest that the government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost of living, but we’ve never said that. These are temporary help measures. They are not long term solutions,” he said.

The cost-of-living measures and SG60 package account for about 5 per cent of the 2025 Budget, he noted.

A “much larger” part of the government’s spending is in structural programmes, in particular to equip and empower Singaporeans through education and skills and job training.

“As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable, the most sustainable way to tackle cost of living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains. That remains the key thrust of our approach,” said PM Wong.

While Singapore has done relatively well, he acknowledged that the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.

This is why the Government has taken steps to strengthen the social support system as part of the Forward Singapore engagement exercise, to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage, he said.

Rising social spending

PM Wong also responded to calls for the Government to make bolder moves on social policies, including PSP Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa’s point on the need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations.

He said the government is prepared to spend more where necessary.

“But it’s equally, if not more, important to get the policies right and to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable,” he said.

He noted that spending on social development is already more than what is spent on the economy and security combined - and is expected to continue growing in the coming years.

“Ultimately, a strong social support system should not be reliant on the government alone, even though the government is going to do more, but it cannot be reliant on the government alone. We will do more, but our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.”

The Government has taken steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of Singapore’s social system and social compact, he added.

These include universal access to primary school, the CPF scheme for retirement, government subsidies for healthcare and the HDB system for housing.

“And we have progressively enhanced these pillars,” said PM Wong, pointing to schemes that target specific groups such as Workfare for lower-wage workers, Silver Support for vulnerable seniors and the broader SkillsFuture scheme for all workers.

Adjustments have been made over the years to continue providing assurance to Singaporeans, he noted.

For example, the CPF system - which turns 70 this year at a time when many pension systems in other countries are struggling with sustainability - allows Singaporeans to save for their own retirement with support from their employers.

Saving for retirement is not left to individuals alone, as families are encouraged to help their loved ones save more while the Government provides risk-free interest rates with extra interest for lower balances.

The Government will continue to review, fine-tune and improve the CPF system to better meet the needs of seniors and to prepare for a future with increased longevity and life expectancy, said PM Wong.

Other areas of social support the Government is looking into include for those with disabilities, caregivers as well as leave arrangements for families.

“We keep an open mind, and we study all your suggestions carefully and beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely and hear views from all Singaporeans,” said PM Wong.

“We may not be able to implement every idea. There will be differences of views, and if we can’t implement it for whatever reason, we will explain why,” he said.

More specifically, headline inflation is reported to be (5.0%, 4.3%, 2.7%) for years (2022, 2023, 2024). But if we look specifically at CPI for food, the numbers are (5.6% 5,8%, 2.7%). And if we look further at food court and coffee shop, we get (5.8%, 6.2%, 3.3%). Food prices in general has risen faster than reported inflation, and food court and coffee shop prices have risen even more rapidly.

To put those numbers into perspective, overall CPI in 2024 increased by 12.4% compared to 2021, Food CPI increased by 14.7%, and coffee shop prices CPI by 16.0% over the same period. I'd love to see data showing that this disproportionate increase is not due to profiteering from gst increases.

They are all politicians. Politicians do politician stuff, and it's entirely up to the electorate to analyze the words that come out of their mouth on their own.

Agreeing or disagreeing with their stances or policies is a much more fruitful and important exercise than to gripe about them being politicians over their words.

>There was absolutely no need for any snide remark insinuating that the Oppositions had a political agenda when all they did were to scrutinise the government's budget, aka the role that they were supposed to do.

But hey, the role they are supposed to do IS political in nature, and doing their jobs IS a political agenda - their agenda is to position themselves as better alternatives to the incumbents and/or to be a form of check and balance.

The incumbents' reactions to this (bringing up the GE) IS also political in nature and serves their own political agenda too.

First, they determine the current value of the basket by calculating how much the basket would cost at today’s prices (multiplying each item’s quantity by its price today and summing up). Next, they determine the value of the basket by calculating how much the basket would cost in a **base period** (multiplying each item’s quantity by its base period price). The price index is then calculated as the ratio of the value of the basket at today’s prices to the value at the base period prices. There is an equivalent but sometimes more convenient formulation to construct a price index that assigns relative weights to the prices of items in the basket. In the case of a price index for consumers, statistical agencies derive the relative weights from consumers’ expenditure patterns using information from consumer surveys and business surveys."" It seems pretty clear that if you introduce GST after the base period, the ratio at today's prices to the base period will go up.

And I'm not saying that. I'm saying having multiple parties debating and attacking/defending policies is a function of a democracy. No one's saying our system is perfect/full fledged.

We the people have our perspectives on the GST hikes.


The incumbents have their own reasonings for the necessity of said hikes. 


Hence it's a debate, rather than a fact finding mission. If you disagree with their reasonings after they try to explain it, fair enough.

"Thanks for the great read. Just to clarify, GST can be both inflationary and anti-inflationary, however in the textbooks, its usually seen more  as a anti-inflationary to lower demand-pull inflation.  
  
Its actually normal that there will be one-time price increase due to transitionary inflation as Inflation is not a one-time thing, but rather the change of rate overtime. If the GST does not frequently increase, then it does not cause inflation in the long run.

It has been stated that there is a planned surplus of 6billion + for fy2025 as well. Therefore, its not an assumption to say that the government will not inject more money into the economy, as it has been told repeatedly that they are saving for rainy days.

The PAP aren't stupid. They've been paying attention to the news and for all the rumours last year about an impending GE, 2024 came and went just like that. It's clear they are waiting for global economic trends to improve before calling the GE so they won't have to suffer the kind of losses incumbent governments suffered all across the world last year. This survey makes it clear the way Singaporeans vote won't be an exception.

But they can't put it off forever. If cost of living and unemployment issues persist, the opposition could stand to make big gains hammering the PAP on these very issues, even though these issues at the mercy of forces beyond the control of the government. Most of the electorate won't care that the government can only do so much to control inflation. And reports of the GDP and economy improving certainly won't sway minds.

"Title: Cost of living tops Singaporeans' concerns ahead of GE, 1 in 4 voters undecided on who to support: Survey 

Article keywords: Singaporeans, cost, living, election, survey

The mood of this article is: Good (sentiment value of 0.12)

SINGAPORE: The cost of living has emerged as the top concern of Singaporeans heading into this year’s general election, for which over a quarter have not yet made up their minds on who they will be voting for, a new survey has found.

Concerns over jobs and unemployment came in second, while the state of the economy followed in third place, according to the study by Blackbox Research’s SensingSG, Singapore’s only public and independent sentiment tracker.

Released on Thursday (Jan 16), the survey was done earlier this month and involved 1,310 Singaporeans eligible to vote in this year’s electoral contest, varied by ethnicity, age, gender, housing type and region to represent national demographics.

The next general election must be held by Nov 23 this year. It will be Singapore’s 14th since independence, and the first under the country’s fourth-generation leadership led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

“Despite all the media noise surrounding politicians in 2024, our findings highlight that Singaporeans are prioritising practical, everyday issues over everything else,” said Blackbox Research founder and CEO David Black.

He noted that factors such as tangible improvements in local government services and the cost of living are at the front of mind of the electorate.

“As we edge closer to GE2025, it’s clear that voters are more focused on their own balance sheets than they are on any wider themes,” said Mr Black.

This partly accounts for their longevity because the more diminished the alternative, the more likely voters will be forgiving towards their only option.

And although someone here argued that nothing else matters as long as PAP wins a majority of votes and seats to govern, the reality is different.

This is because the bastion of the ruling party lies in the executive branch while the bastion of the opposition is in the legislative branch, so the latter needs to be sizeable in the legislative to stand a chance to present themselves as an alternative.

Why not ask, how would the poorest 20% of working households think? I'm specifically comparing to the lowest 20% because that's a key target of cheap hawker food.

We can't rob the poor to save the poor.

Especially if you want to compare with Nordic countries, why not compare a bit more?

Norwegians spends less on food and have more time. 21.4% vs 26.6% on food and dining services. They work average 36.9 hours/week (2023, settled working hours, 30-54 YO, excl. immigrants), vs ours at 43.3 hours!

They can go home and cook. Assuming 5-day week, they have 1.28 hours more each day! We also spend a lot more time on commuting vs them.

Norwegians also have pensions. They get around $1689 a month, for life! To get that much from CPF LIFE, you need $308,900 in your CPF! Healthcare is capped there, so they don't blow life savings on healthcare. The Norwegians can spend without too much worry, even for the poor. *Try doing that in Singapore*.

Our poor already earns more than the equivalent poorest Norwegians, even *after* taking home 20% less of what I quoted above if you assume highest CPF rates (worse case, not even a fully realistic assumption)!

You are expecting 2 hands to clap and you only want to provide the 1 hand (high prices) but not the other (low cost of living relative to income, more free time, and spending security).

**I'm not saying we cannot do more for hawkers.** If we want to progress and make everyone secure and prosperous, then let's start with having social safety net from poverty and spending security, and decent work-life balance, then sure, we can have Nordic level of pricing for eat-out food.

It's clear if we advocate for Nordic pricing now, what we get is oppression of the poor. And not to mention I'm not even entirely convinced how landlords can't leech off.

One last thing, if hawker food becomes very expensive, there will be far less demand for hawker food. Many hawkers will go out of business.

Questionable benefit and yet many people are made worse off. Who wins?

"This take is painfully **oversimplified** and cherry-picks examples to fit a narrative while ignoring the full picture. Let’s break it down.

First, saying **“Capitalism (with strong institutions) is working”** is redundant. **Of course, capitalism works when it has strong institutions**—that’s like saying **“cars (with good roads and maintenance) are working.”** The real question is whether capitalism inherently leads to strong institutions, and history shows that’s not always the case.

Now, let’s look at the **cherry-picked examples:**

* **China’s Reform and Opening-Up** → Yes, China embraced market reforms, but it did so under **state-controlled capitalism**, not the free-market model you’re implying. The government still plays a massive role in the economy, directing resources and maintaining control over key industries. If anything, China proves that **capitalism without strong state intervention is unstable**.
* **Nordic Model** → The Nordic countries are **not** purely capitalist. They have **high taxes, strong social safety nets, and extensive state involvement** in key sectors like healthcare and education. If anything, they prove that **regulated capitalism with socialist elements works best**—not the unregulated capitalism that free-market extremists love to push.
* **Post-Soviet Eastern Europe & Baltics** → While some countries like Estonia succeeded, many others suffered massive economic **shock therapy disasters** in the 1990s. Russia’s transition led to **oligarchic capitalism, corruption, and economic collapse**, proving that capitalism without strong institutions can easily go off the rails. Even in the Baltics, the 2008 financial crisis hit them **harder than most of Europe** due to their rapid privatization.
* **Cuba** → Yes, Cuba struggles economically, but it also has been under a **decades-long US embargo** that has crippled its trade and financial access. If you’re going to compare economic models fairly, you have to account for **external pressures**, not just internal policy choices.

The argument is self-defeating because **every single ""successful"" example relied on strong state intervention** rather than pure capitalism. The real takeaway isn’t **“capitalism works”** but rather **“a balanced mix of capitalism and state regulation works”**.

"I actually agree on his response because if you consider foreign workers working here, can their wages really sustain in Singapore with both feet on the ground?

This is how the G-man road map works - Every few years a new and upcoming industry pop up, they want us to be software engineers, Bankers, Data analyst and so on. 

Then those industries that are really fundamental to our society such as plumbers and ACMV & drivers they tender out to the lowest bidder. And because we don't have minimum wage back then Singaporeans realised the pay cannot sustain the high cost of living obviously they ain't going to apply. So instead of supply & demand coming in and say, ""Let's increase drivers pay to attract more locals"", the G-man instead be like ""More foreigners to come in to cover skills gap"". I find that's the method to try and get Singaporeans to indirectly go up the income ladder.

Right. Except that's not what you said from the start. You said, very clearly, that:

""Time for us to reflect and rethink whether Capitalism is actually working.""

Then now you're backtracking? Keep in mind, the Nordic Model, Reform and Opening Up, Ordoliberalism, etc are all variants of capitalism! Ordoliberalism is literally called *Rhine Capitalism*.

Also as a tangent, any debate requires you to give a definition of capitalism (as well as capitalism prime - let's just denote it as C and C' for ease of future reference). Since you didn't it requires me to tiptoe and try to guess what your definition of capitalism is, and so far, it seems to be more of a normative vague changeable thing rather than an actual defined concept, given how you advocate for the overthrow of capitalism only to go back and defend what is quite literally called ""Rhine Capitalism""

You see the crux of the issue here? A few sentences telling you to correct your formatting to make it more legible isn't ""making it my entire argument"" but according to you, it is. All I want is for you make it easier for me to read your comment so I can understand it better, but unfortunately in your little brain, telling you that you have poor diction and formatting is somehow making it ""my entire argument"".

That makes it so incredibly hard to talk to you when you just have this level of disingenuous line of thinking. You have just an astonishingly shit level of epistemics. So according to you, I can never tell you to correct your shit formatting because that would mean I'm suddenly making it my entire argument?

Are you that triggered by someone calling you out on your diction and style that you seemingly think so highly of?

Because they're annoying and making it hard to read.

*I did tear your arguments apart*.

Also, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. You are creating a false dichotomy. Again go back to how fallacious your logic is. You can both tear a person's argument *and*, as the cherry on top, tell a person to use proper legible formatting.

>	You’re just throwing around AI detector nonsense

Right. So you refuse to admit that you use AI to write you comments (plural, because I'm also referring to your comment history in other comment chains and where there is a clear distinction between your natural writing and AI generated comments).

See, in Philosophical Logic from Popper, we learn that in order to test something, it must be falsifiable. Since you clearly do not accept and admit that you used AI, and there is no method by which we can both agree to *test* that for that falsifiability, thus this line of dialogue is fruitless. Especially for a layman in AI like you.

What I say however is that AI detectors aren't nonsense. I could go on to talk about fingerprinting, how LLMs over w.r.t MLPs, transformers, probability distributions + AI Safety, etc, but I sincerely doubt you understand any of that and the underlying math. So what I will do is leave you to read up on it.

>	which, by the way, flags anything remotely coherent as A

No. This is objectively false.

You seem to think that AI detectors will flag as AI anything that's well-written or ""coherent"", Etc. This is false. That is not how AI detectors work and I can mathematically prove it via pattern recognition, fingerprinting, and by borrowing approaches from linguistics to identify repeated structures. 

If anything, AI detectors flag out unnatural badly-written speech rather than coherent ""well-written"" speech.

>	This is just a lazy cop-out.

Partially Correct. It is a laziness but it is not a cop-out. Why should I explain it when I'm just copying pasting what's written in *Why Nations Fail*? All I have to do is direct you to it. And since you clearly know how to use AI, ask gpt to summarise AJR's work.

>	If it’s so “established,” then explain it instead of expecting everyone to just accept your vague assertions.

If are having a debate about quantum mechanics, do I need to first establish everything down from Newtonian Mechanics? Why is it my responsibility to account for your ignorance?

I expect someone who wants to debate economics to already know who won last year's Nobel. I expect someone who wants to debate capitalism to know what Ordoliberalism or what the Permanent Income Hypothesis is (and ideally be able to derive it mathematically). It is stupid to want to cover Econs 201 material and then be angry when Econs 101 knowledge is assumed to be a prerequisite.

>	The inverse of capitalism has never ever worked.” → What even is the inverse of capitalism? This person refuses to define their terms. 

Keep in mind that ***you*** are the one who first used the word capitalism. You are the one refusing to define what capitalism is. Surely by ""this person"" you're referring to yourself?

When I talk about capitalism, I'm talking about the accepted working definition in Economics. The one you find on Wikipedia and in textbooks. An umbrella definition that covers everything from Laissez-faire to MMT (again, if you don't know what MMT is, it's a mark on your ignorance and go read up on it) and Social Democracy and even elements of Democratic Socialism. 

>	But capitalism without regulations and strong institutions has also failed repeatedly (see: financial crashes, wealth inequality, monopolies choking competition). The most successful economies are mixed economies, not pure free-market capitalism.

Again, I will point out the irony of you being against ""Capitalism"" (a vague nebulous term that you have not defined and that I have no idea what your definition is) whilst simultaneously arguing for Rhine Capitalism (Ordoliberalism, etc).

So you're.... Pro-capitalism? Or anti? Or what? What's your definition here

>	First off, name the actual prize winner instead of being vague.

Are you stupid? Like genuinely? I've named them like multiple times - AJR!

Literally anyone who is in the field recognises them. Hell, the moment I mention institutions any student of economics should have their names pop up already in their head given their immense popularity in the field.

>	But that does not prove that unregulated capitalism is the best system.

And who is arguing for unregulated capitalism exactly? Or is your definition of capitalism laissez-faire capitalism? So you exclude Rhine Capitalism from the definition of capitalism?

>	This is laughably false. Economics is filled with debates—monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxation, trade, welfare models, etc. If economists didn’t debate, we wouldn’t have different schools of economic thought. 

Look. I know I'm talking to a proud dunning-kruger ignoramus here, but do me a favour and look up the IGMChiacgo database.

Again, I find myself repeating **over and over and over and over again**. Just because physicists debate over quantum mechanics does not mean that gravity does not exist. Yes, Economics is filled with debate. Every field is. If a field has no debate, it wouldn't be staffed and researched anymore in academia because there is no incentive.

But what I said is true (again you have a habit of trying to create false dichotomies when none exists - That's not how proof by contradiction works). Economists debate less than you think because a lot of basic fundamental issues (especially inconsequential normative stuff like how to define capitalism) has been settled.

What is being debated, especially in places like NBER (if you don't already know what NBER is before commenting on the state of economics as an academic field, then you're proving my point about your ignorance and dunning-kruger) is the specific models and underlying mathematics. The neoclassical synthesis has been concluded.

>	What alternatives to capitalism are you talking about?” → Again, a misrepresentation. The point isn’t replacing capitalism but rather improving it with better regulations and social policies. Saying, “Oh, so you want communism?” is a strawman argument. No one is saying capitalism should be scrapped entirely, but rather that it should be structured in a way that benefits more people instead of just the wealthiest.

You literally started out by saying we should rethink capitalism. So how was I supposed to interpret that? You are obviously advocating for C' (please go back to see the notation system in my previous comment). Whatever C' (Capitalism prime/inverse) is left undefined *by you*.

I have no idea what you might mean by C'. I didn't say communism at all. You are trying to push for me to say it so that you can label it as a strawman argument but I have never even used the word ""communism"" except when quoting you.

>	that’s failed in most cases. 

It failed in *every* case.

>	No one is saying capitalism should be scrapped entirely, but rather that it should be structured in a way that benefits more people instead of just the wealthiest.

So.... Rhine Capitalism? 

>	Because it’s a lazy reference. If they’re talking about an Economics Nobel, just say the name and the findings instead of expecting people to look it up. 

Why? I expect you to already know who AJR is when you debate Economic! I don't expect you to even look it up. I expect you to already know.

*Why Nations Fail* is literally freshman year assigned reading!

Also poor epistemics. Saying that ""it's a lazy reference"" does not refute the point that it's a ""vague"" reference. The reference is clear. Even if it were a ""lazy reference"", it was still a ""clear"" one.

GST exemptions on necessities sound appealing in theory, but they don't quite add up in practice. Let's break it down into two parts: implementation costs and actual benefits.

Implementation costs would be substantial. Defining what constitutes a ""necessity"" is a challenge, as evidenced by numerous court cases in other countries debating whether specific products qualify. For instance, a UK case argued whether a food item was a biscuit or a cake, with tax implications. 

Administering such a system would require significant taxpayer funding to establish a department to categorize every item sold in Singapore. Additional tax audits would be necessary to ensure accurate reporting, incurring more administrative and legal costs.

Now, let's examine the benefits. If we exempt GST on necessities, three groups would benefit: low-income citizens, higher-income citizens, and non-citizens (which is approx 2.4 million people). All would save on GST, regardless of their financial situation.

In contrast, our current GSTV scheme targets support specifically at low-income citizens, providing them with more substantial assistance. To illustrate, if all three groups pay $10 in GST, exempting necessities would save each group $10. However, our current system collects $30 and redistributes it to the poor, providing more meaningful support.

Given the costs and inefficiencies, GST exemptions on necessities seem like a costly and ineffective solution. Our current system is more targeted and beneficial to those who need it most.",paste wrote day back gst exemption necessity sound appealing theory dont quite add practice let break two part implementation cost actual benefit implementation cost substantial defining constitutes necessity challenge evidenced numerous court case country debating whether specific product qualify instance uk case argued whether food item biscuit cake tax implication administering system require significant taxpayer funding establish department categorize every item sold additional tax audit necessary ensure accurate reporting incurring administrative legal cost let examine benefit exempt gst necessity three group benefit lowincome citizen higherincome citizen noncitizen approx million people save gst regardless financial situation contrast current gstv scheme target support specifically lowincome citizen providing substantial assistance illustrate three group pay gst exempting necessity save group however current system collect redistributes poor providing meaningful support given cost inefficiency gst exemption necessity seem costly ineffective solution current system targeted beneficial need,Neutral,0.9318819046020508

Corporate tax is so easy to dodge. You can manipulate your profit margins and claim plenty of deductibles Thats why all these big firms gets away with paying fuck all. And it's all legal!

Its very hard to legally manipulate income... unless you are going to straight out put fake numbers... The GST is charged at the point of sale.

"Capital gains tax will result in capital flight. The lack of it is why we have high inflow of capital way above our weight.

"You're missing the point.

There's 2 parts: taxation and redistribution.

There are different taxation methods.  GST is the most efficient and broadest way of generating taxes. Income taxes target the higher incomes, but  too much and high net worth individuals will flee. Same as wealth taxes. 

Singapore's economic strategy as a small country is to attract capital inflow. That's why we keep our income taxes low at the highest bracket. GST is the most efficient method in increasing revenue.

"the solution is short term pain for long term gain, rather than temporary fixes that merely kick the can down the road. 

let’s define the solution as “income that rise more naturally in response to growing costs of living”. this means things like entrepreneurship, productivity and holistic sustainability (long term) are good focuses, while rent-seeking, monopolies and unsustainable (short term) growth are bad focuses. 

price rises are due to demand increases beyond supply availability. the “singapore way” is to let market forces work and allow higher prices to reduce demand. this can work well with things like luxuries (cars vs COE and ERP pricing), but some demands cannot be priced away (e.g. food or shelter). 

to reduce overheads, the main target appears to be labour, which we resolve by bringing in cheaper migrant labour. but migrants still “compete” for the supply of food and shelter (which, as we posit, cannot be priced away). 

clearly, these fall into the “bad” focuses - short term and rent-seeking. 

to reverse this, we need better incentives for broad-based entrepreneurship to solve local problems (e.g. we don’t need more middlemen or “commissioned agents”, we need providers of real products and services that address local needs), to do so with more efficiency (e.g. automation, vs short term cheap labour) and to pay for these through higher taxes (e.g. a capital gains tax may disincentivise property speculation and/or a punitive estate tax, which punishes multigenerational hoarding of wealth and assets but incentivises early distribution of accumulated wealth).

we could also end “for profit” public housing and refocus on affordability that meets changing needs. allowing a glut of housing will bring housing prices down and disincentivise landlords. 

similarly, rent control on commercial property will do the same, making it less risky to be entrepreneurial. you are more likely to start a business if rents are affordable, and more likely to succeed if your landlord doesn’t double your rent just because you do well in one financial year. making rents fixed over longer periods (say five years) with increases that can be contested (e.g proper rent consultants who work for the renter, and not only for the landlord) will help small businesses become more sustainable (rather than incentivising large international chains who control prices through scale - haven’t you noticed how every mall in SG seems to have the same tenants?)

when these small businesses focus on solving local problems (e.g. higher value goods and services that are needed by the community), we create a virtuous cycle of useful wealth creation. 

this will be painful to developers with large land banks, and to ordinary singaporeans who have already overinvested in the HDB leasehold “scam”. however, this pain will be temporary (~ two generations or so).

low risk, high return rent-seeking is not significantly different from the feudalism and slavery, yet it is what we have been taught to aspire to. this, i feel, must end.",solution short term pain long term gain rather temporary fix merely kick road let define solution income rise naturally response growing cost living mean thing entrepreneurship productivity holistic sustainability long term good focus rentseeking monopoly unsustainable short term growth bad focus price rise due demand increase beyond supply availability way let market force work allow higher price reduce demand work well thing luxury car v coe erp pricing demand priced away eg food shelter reduce overhead main target appears labour resolve bringing cheaper migrant labour migrant still compete supply food shelter posit priced away clearly fall bad focus short term rentseeking reverse need better incentive broadbased entrepreneurship solve local problem eg dont need middleman commissioned agent need provider real product service address local need efficiency eg automation v short term cheap labour pay higher tax eg capital gain tax may disincentivise property speculation andor punitive estate tax punishes multigenerational hoarding wealth asset incentivises early distribution accumulated wealth could end profit public housing refocus affordability meet changing need allowing glut housing bring housing price disincentivise landlord similarly rent control commercial property making less risky entrepreneurial likely start business rent affordable likely succeed landlord doesnt double rent well financial year making rent fixed longer period say five year increase contested eg proper rent consultant work renter landlord help small business become sustainable rather incentivising large international chain control price scale havent noticed every mall seems tenant small business focus solving local problem eg higher value good service needed community create virtuous cycle useful wealth creation painful developer large land bank ordinary singaporean already overinvested hdb leasehold scam however pain temporary two generation low risk high return rentseeking significantly different feudalism slavery yet taught aspire feel must end,Neutral,0.8767494559288025

"Cost of living going up is a major thing and I feel that alot of it is pretty much inevitable. Having worked overseas for extended periods, many Singaporeans don’t realize how insane it is for a global city with our average wages to have food options at these prices. Also, taking into account average wages against cost of living, we aren’t faring that badly.

I’m not saying we should adopt a grateful stance devoid of any criticism but with inflation being a worldwide phenomenon, it is what it is. To me, cash is king. We can’t fight agains the direction of the tide but we can always look to lower our expenses whenever we can, without sacrificing too much comfort. 

However I can’t help but feel sad or sorry for upcoming graduates both now and in the future. I don’t think this is a cyclical recession issue with regards to work opportunities but more of saturation over the years of the workforce and lesser opportunities as Singapore starts to lose its appeal as an APAC destination for MNCs. Being at the top pretty much means it can only go downhill from there.

That being said, it’s not the end of the world and I strongly encourage younger Singaporeans to head abroad if a work opportunity presents itself. Your world and career isn’t limited to geographical boundaries and not to sound snarky, but Singaporeans really have it good in this aspect for a long time. In pretty much most developed first world economies, it’s a norm that you have to move cities/states for your studies and also for work if you don’t live in the capital. Only in Singapore do you get to do all of the above in the same place. At the risk of overgeneralizing, I think it has made us stale in a way. And those ‘good times’ are coming to an end in my opinion.

“We’re not meant to save the world. We’re meant to leave it.” Kind of overdramatic but you get the point.",cost living going major thing feel alot pretty much inevitable worked overseas extended period many singaporean dont realize insane global city average wage food option price taking account average wage cost living arent faring badly saying adopt grateful stance devoid criticism inflation worldwide phenomenon cash king cant fight agains direction tide always look lower expense whenever without sacrificing much comfort however cant help feel sad sorry upcoming graduate future dont think cyclical recession issue regard work opportunity saturation year workforce lesser opportunity start lose appeal apac destination mncs top pretty much mean go downhill said end world strongly encourage younger singaporean head abroad work opportunity present world career isnt limited geographical boundary sound snarky singaporean good aspect long time pretty much developed first world economy norm move citiesstates study work dont live capital place risk overgeneralizing think made u stale way good time coming end opinion meant save world meant leave kind overdramatic point,Neutral,0.557680606842041

Which I understand. so the mothers either stop doing for their sons once the DIL lives with them, but sons just don't do it either! so the mothers get mad coz omg, the house is now a pigsty. or the mothers (to me wrongly) expects the DIL to do the sons and their own chores. which makes a lot of angst for the DIL. or the mother just decides to continue for the son but not the DIL, which makes the DIL angst coz she isn't considered ""part of the family"". OR the mother sucks it up and does chores for both usually very unwillingly. 

  
solution - sons should be more aware and suck it up. but I dunno why that is rare. probably as majority of men can't seem to see that there is something that needs to be done now! or maybe its more of like man and woman have different view of how much needs to be done, and how urgently it needs to be done.

"Can’t speak for the UK, but I personally moved to the US for grad school. Simple answer is the best schools in the US are mostly located on the HCOL coasts, and Singaporeans who move here for school tend to find a community where they studied at, and therefore, a job here in the same area.

Others have also noted that most high wage white collar jobs are found in HCOL areas; and the simple math here is that the HCOL-LCOL wage difference **outweighs** the HCOL-COL difference in COL.

Anecdotally, a typical (probably lower than median) wage in the SF Bay Area is about 100k USD per annum, which leaves you with a take home of about 84k after taxes. At my company, the median wage is 300k per annum. It’s also common practice for companies to offer vastly different wages for the **EXACT SAME** job (my company offers 180k for a SWE role in the bay area/NYC, but only 80k outside of both metropolitan areas). 

In comparison, you’d be hard pressed to even find a job at the same experience level paying 80k pre-tax in a LCOL area in the US (even at the best companies in the country), and factoring in taxes leaves you with about 67k USD post-tax. 

So, unless the COL difference is at least 17k per year, it wouldn’t make financial sense to move to a LCOL place and start anew. Even if the COL difference is more than 17k a year, there are lots of immaterial advantages that HCOL places have over LCOL places (after all, HCOL places are HCOL for a reason — people like living there). 

In the SF bay area, that’s the perfect 15 degrees weather everyday, and the abundance of green spaces and authentic asian food (if you believe that California is a dangerous hellscape, please stop watching Fox News and I urge you to visit SF for just a day); in NYC, it’s the city that never sleeps. 

You may save more at the end of the day if you get a remote job that pays a HCOL wage, but move to a LCOL place to live, but that’s extremely tough in this job market today. 

So, as with all things emigration, the question it boils down to is—**are you happy living and working where you are; and are you happy earning the wage that you do while living in said place?**",cant speak uk personally moved u grad school simple answer best school u mostly located hcol coast singaporean move school tend find community studied therefore job area others noted high wage white collar job found hcol area simple math hcollcol wage difference outweighs hcolcol difference col anecdotally typical probably lower median wage sf bay area k usd per annum leaf take home k tax company median wage k per annum common practice company offer vastly different wage exact job company offer k swe role bay areanyc k outside metropolitan area comparison youd hard pressed even find job experience level paying k pretax lcol area u even best company country factoring tax leaf k usd posttax unless col difference least k per year wouldnt make financial sense move lcol place start anew even col difference k year lot immaterial advantage hcol place lcol place hcol place hcol reason people living sf bay area thats perfect degree weather everyday abundance green space authentic asian food believe california dangerous hellscape please stop watching fox news urge visit sf day nyc city never sleep may save end day remote job pay hcol wage move lcol place live thats extremely tough job market today thing emigration question boil isare happy living working happy earning wage living said place,Neutral,0.958634078502655

"Full disclosure: I am a fee-based financial advisor serving HNW clients. The following are general insights, not personalized advice.

USD 4,000 (\~SGD 5,300) monthly in dividends alone can certainly support a comfortable lifestyle in Singapore, especially given your inherited condo eliminates housing costs (typically the largest expense). Your situation is actually quite favorable for leaving the workforce, though a part-time role would add both income security and social structure.

Looking at your financial picture: Your investable assets total approximately USD 850k (700k RSUs + 150k 401k) plus SGD 120k CPF, which translates to roughly SGD 1.3 million excluding your property. The 4% withdrawal rule would suggest sustainable annual withdrawals around SGD 52,000 (\~SGD 4,300 monthly), which aligns closely with your current dividend income. For comparison, Singapore's median household income is about SGD 9,000, but that typically covers multiple people and housing costs.

Regarding your specific questions:

1. For your 401(k), strongly consider transferring it to a Traditional IRA and leaving it invested in the US rather than withdrawing. Early withdrawal penalties plus taxes could cost 30-40% of your balance. The US-Singapore tax treaty allows for favorable treatment of these withdrawals during retirement.
2. Your RSU concentration represents significant single-company risk. Consider gradually diversifying into a global portfolio while being mindful of tax implications of selling.
3. CPF top-ups are worth considering for the tax benefits if you take on part-time work in Singapore, but may not be your highest priority given your asset base.

The conventional advice for returning Singaporeans is to immediately rebuild retirement accounts and secure full-time employment. However, your financial position is stronger than most. The key consideration isn't just whether you can afford to stop working, but creating a sustainable withdrawal strategy that accounts for inflation, healthcare costs (especially with your condition), and the psychological aspects of early retirement.

Your condo maintenance fees warrant analysis as if they exceed SGD 1,000 monthly, downsizing to a newer, smaller unit might improve your cash flow and reduce future maintenance headaches, though transaction costs are significant.

"Since you already have a place and some savings and passive income, definitely able to afford to stop working. Main bulk of cost of living in SG is mortgage and medical. If you are healthy then the passive income will allow you to even save up more money in SG.

The problem though is medical, not sure if you have a green card in US, if you have a green card then US medical maybe cheaper than SG. Medical bills are subsidized for Singaporeans but even after subsidy it can still be very expensive, things can go up to 5 or even 6 digits. If anything happens to you, and it maybe hard for you to buy insurance since you have a medical history so you need to keep aside a bigger amount of savings for emergencies. The good thing about SG is there are places you can seek help from if you have no income, but likely you will need someone to help you to apply and stuff if something were to happen to you.

As for CPF i think you can wait until you're back, enjoy a bit of life before deciding whether to CPF top up, once the money goes in you can't take it out. 

As for the 4 bedder, what kind of condo is it, is it a boutique project or big development, how much sinking fund does it have ? If sinking fund is low, sometime after you stay in you maybe asked to top up the sinking fund which may be up to a 5 digit sum. 

I won't suggest to rent it out then rent another place because rental is a pain, when you rent the place out the tenant won't take care of the unit, there will be a lot of loose ends, every time you rent it out and take back you need to check the place and touch up for new tenant, sometimes things in the house spoil and there will be conflicts and arguments between you and the tenant, a lot depends on luck on what kind of tenant will you be getting, for a 4 bedder likely you will be getting a huge family, meaning a lot more things to look at. 

When you rent the place out, its also income tax-able, but since you are not planning to do a full time job you might not even be taxed for it, but its just the hassle and stress, your reason for moving back is to live a less stressful life, might as well sell your place and buy another place. 

Will suggest either you : 

* Try to buy a HDB, e.g sell your condo, rent a place, wait 15 months then buy a HDB, or appeal to HDB to waive the 15months wait
* Sell your 4 bedder condo and look for a smaller unit, 2 bedder or 3 bedder \~ likely your 4 bedder is old and need to touch up the place, so might as well just sell and look for smaller units, right now the market is in demand for big size units so its easy to sell, there are a lot more 2 bedrooms in SG so its easier to buy a smaller unit
* Consider renovating your 4 bedder into a dual key unit (subjected to management approval), recently there are a lot of IDs doing this, so you can do like a 2 or 3 bedroom unit and the other side a 1 or 2 bedder so you can enjoy privacy while earning more passive income, you have to spend quite a bit to renovate though",since already place saving passive income definitely able afford stop working main bulk cost living mortgage medical healthy passive income allow even save money problem though medical sure green card u green card u medical maybe cheaper medical bill subsidized singaporean even subsidy still expensive thing go even digit anything happens maybe hard buy insurance since medical history need keep aside bigger amount saving emergency good thing place seek help income likely need someone help apply stuff something happen cpf think wait youre back enjoy bit life deciding whether cpf top money go cant take bedder kind condo boutique project big development much sinking fund sinking fund low sometime stay maybe asked top sinking fund may digit sum wont suggest rent rent another place rental pain rent place tenant wont take care unit lot loose end every time rent take back need check place touch new tenant sometimes thing house spoil conflict argument tenant lot depends luck kind tenant getting bedder likely getting huge family meaning lot thing look rent place income taxable since planning full time job might even taxed hassle stress reason moving back live less stressful life might well sell place buy another place suggest either try buy hdb eg sell condo rent place wait month buy hdb appeal hdb waive month wait sell bedder condo look smaller unit bedder bedder likely bedder old need touch place might well sell look smaller unit right market demand big size unit easy sell lot bedroom easier buy smaller unit consider renovating bedder dual key unit subjected management approval recently lot id bedroom unit side bedder enjoy privacy earning passive income spend quite bit renovate though,Neutral,0.9382409453392029
"• Sustainability of Retirement

If you do up your expected steady expenses after experiencing life back in SG for a few months, that should give you a clearer idea how long and how probable your financial assets can sustain your early retirement.

• Impact to Current Dividends?
Is your dividend generating portfolio (assumed to be primarily US equities) currently taxed at a resident alien rate? Once you have relocated, the taxation will jump to 30%.

If it is not primarily US equities, the stability of that dividend payout can be ceteris paribus estimated.

• Vested RSUs

Although you would be familiar with the trajectory of the underlying business as an employee, the RSUs probably form a large proportion of your financial assets. Purely from a positioning POV and that your currency with near-term developments and trajectory of the company will drop, perhaps you may want to encashing a portion of it to switch to other income generating and income growth financial assets while still remaining vested in a business that you probably got in at a good price. The idea is to start reinforcing your cashflow generation to deal with future medical costs.

Likewise, I couldn't live in Singapore anymore because I couldn't bear the conversations anymore and the insular way of thinking. My health has also improved, friends say I look younger, and I have a lot more time to dive into hobbies now, even if they don't make me money. I can do them, just because. Stuff like learning to draw, learning another language, surfing etc. The downsides are like you said - you have to face the real questions in life without the distractions of work - what is the real meaning and purpose of life etc.

"Thank you for your sharing. The content was sincere and relatable. The pros and cons are very real. I have made preparations to kick-start my FIRE journey,  and  I'm ready for it to be executed soon with God's blessings and timing.

I like your sharing about structured and unstructured time, gave yourself time to settle down with the change, disconnect from corporate life, regain back your sense of purpose in this life to do the things meaningful to you and your family. 

I agree with your comments about many people talked about FIRE but few actually do it in Singapore. Some I know, worry about their finances, and if their savings could sustain their current  lifestyle. They were some survey and statistics generated recently,  in order to retire comfortably, needs about 1.3M. I'm not sure if this 1.3M was including or excluding CPF savings. Having said this, most people in Singapore if possible to continue working until 63 or more and looking forward to CPF Life payout. Those below retirement age of 63, would think twice because of the loss of regular income. And most people may not have another source of income e.g equities investment and dividends, income from options premiums, real estate rental, any side hustle that generates some income, either passive or active. 

It is of very great importance for anyone who wants to consider FIRE to know how to generate another or more source of income other than their salary. 

It was very encouraging to read your post and indeed a great achievement for you to FIRE below 40! Great job! 

As for me, I am not reaching retirement age anytime near. My first pit stop will be at 55, and I'm looking forward to this life journey without the worries of corporate life and night calls. My focus will be similar to yours, finding time for activities that will bring more meaning to me in this life, and for me to be involved in community work, church ministry and services. I read and know about many people who stopped working without a plan, and most want to travel and go on holidays. It is not possible to travel and go on holidays 365 days/year, maybe once every quarter it's possible with some personal objectives. In my opinion, it is equally important for anyone who plans to FIRE, to plan the activities  to fill time with focus and meaning, or else boredom will start to kick in, and many had health problems afterwards, mental illness such as depression and anxiety disorder etc
Many I know had gone back to work because they cannot sustain the unstructured time, and lack of interactions with collegues had caused them to be isolated. So it is important to have friends outside work, and to have strong connection with immediate family members ie spouse, children, parents, siblings, pets etc.

In my opinion, FIRE is not a solo endeavor but requires support and accountability. If anyone who wants to FIRE and has not considered the complexity that comes with it, the journey is going to be short-lived and disastrous.

"Thanks again for the share and a thoughtful question. I've been running around the past few days and considering it. 

What I've settled on is that ego currently feels like 'a sense of status thanks to my role at work'. There's a small high in being a dependable leader and team player (I work in advertising). The best comparative metaphor is like being in an influential role on a sports team. 

Thinking about it over the long weekend, I guess I could try to find that within another non-work setting after the RE. 

Wishing you a wonderful journey mate. I suppose long weekends are just extra family time now?

Had my career highlights leading global teams and projects that drove billions of revenues and costs, realising long term strategic priorities and the glory that comes with it (comp, bonuses, the celebration off sites, business class travels  etc), it's hard to picture an alternative option that would beat this. 

My view is that if this tickles your juice, keep doing it! 

These turned me on for years until they didn't. So I became curious and reflected on why :)

"Can't speak for Ireland but I was in Frankfurt for some years before moving to SG.  Frankfurt has similar salaries to Dublin but with a lower COL. I went to Dublin a few times and found prices for eating and drinking to be almost comparable to NYC which is probably 30-40% more than Frankfurt. Rents were also more expensive along with almost everything else. Pint of Guinness was about the only affordable thing there. I honestly didn't understand how anyone could afford life in Dublin.

I moved from Frankfurt to SG with my P2, I didn't work because I am already FIRE'd but she is not. Her net salary doubled. Same job, same position, same title, same everything. Double the net salary. Cost of living is definitely higher in SG but with double the net salary, the ability to save money goes through the roof.

I woudl say SG and Dublin are probably about comparable with COL with slightly lower rents in Dublin. Dublin has no cheap hawker food thoguh so keep that in mind. SG is generally cheaper than NYC from rent and food/drinks point of view. Of course, carownership is more expensive in SG but no one needs a car in SG. it's only for vanity.",cant speak ireland frankfurt year moving frankfurt similar salary dublin lower col went dublin time found price eating drinking almost comparable nyc probably frankfurt rent expensive along almost everything else pint guinness affordable thing honestly didnt understand anyone could afford life dublin moved frankfurt p didnt work already fired net salary doubled job position title everything double net salary cost living definitely higher double net salary ability save money go roof woudl say dublin probably comparable col slightly lower rent dublin dublin cheap hawker food thoguh keep mind generally cheaper nyc rent fooddrinks point view course carownership expensive need car vanity,Negative,0.6348257064819336

"I lived in Ireland 2014-2019, Singapore is somewhat better and I moved back mainly because of the familiarity. If you were Irish you might feel Ireland is better because of subjective familiarity. 


Specifically related to cost of living to answer OP’s question - Ireland is much cheaper. Only issue is you don’t have the cheap option of hawker centre but then again you shouldn’t be eating that everyday. 
If you cook at home - groceries are fresher and cost much less at stores like Tesco. Esp local poultry and veggies, milk, anything that goes through the local supply chain even Ben and Jerry’s - half the price vs sg. 
2L milk there €1.69, vs Meiji here $6.95
1kg Chicken leg there €3, here $12.80 

Eating at restaurants in Ireland vs Singapore. Actually menu prices in Ireland are marginally lower if you compare like for like, but theirs is nett pricing. Drinks are also cheaper. So in the end dining in sg is probably 30-40% more ex vs Ireland. 

Rent: prices have gone up there and locals are complaining, but for a 4000+ sq ft landed 5 BR house I rented in the equivalent of Bt Timah over in Dublin it was €4500 per month, you just compare to how much the same house would cost here. Easily $18000. 

Cars: we have the most expensive cars in the world. 

Taxes: yes theirs are higher",lived ireland somewhat better moved back mainly familiarity irish might feel ireland better subjective familiarity specifically related cost living answer ops question ireland much cheaper issue dont cheap option hawker centre shouldnt eating everyday cook home grocery fresher cost much less store tesco esp local poultry veggie milk anything go local supply chain even ben jerry half price v l milk v meiji kg chicken leg eating restaurant ireland v actually menu price ireland marginally lower compare nett pricing drink cheaper end dining probably ex v ireland rent price gone local complaining sq ft landed br house rented equivalent bt timah dublin per month compare much house cost easily car expensive car world tax yes higher,Neutral,0.7948131561279297
