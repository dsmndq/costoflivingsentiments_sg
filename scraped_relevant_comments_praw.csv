Every single time they ask this question to ppl the top answer has always been living costs.. I have never seen one that indicated anything else. Yet our highly paid ministers always seem surprised...
"Another factor that needs to be taken into account is that the working hours are 9am-6pm, unlike 9am-5pm in all the other Western first world countries that Singapore tries to pretend it is. What the fuck is the point of having children if you come home at 7pm exhausted and barely have time to spend with them?"
"Its kinda sad when both parents have to work to live in this country. Getting home at 7pm and being only able to spend 2hour plus with your kid. Is this the kind of ""family life"" people want? Obviously not."
Government fails to bring cost of living down but still asking Singaporean to have more kids.
"No need AI also can answer.  I do have a legitimate question. If birthrates are the urgent goal. Shouldn't the objective be so family orientated? 

The economic and social climate would have reflected a family centric society. I.e cost of raising children and feeding a family would not be so high and could be done by a single persons income. 

Education would seem much different than the current state it's in. Housing wouldn't be this expensive and society would be less consumerist and more saving by nature. 

It seems like they have given up on it as a whole. Kicking the can down the road. 

Just curious because I hear one thing and I see another thing happening around me."
"Insane. Doing the same thing over and over again, and expecting different results."
"Support the families that already have kids, and want more kids, and support them in all aspect. Kids need space, they need parents with a big heart, parents who set aside a career for them, they need siblings, they need classes and tuition and activities and time w parents, these things cost money. Especially time with parents. 

Stop wasting time with scare tactics or pressure tactics with couples who don’t want kids anyway. And stop using immigrabtion as a way of making up for population decline. It’s making things worse"
"Chicken rice has gone from $2.50 to $4 now in less than 2 years. So you can guess the magnitude of the living cost issue here now. Will the $4 price hold in the next 2 years? At the rate we are going, the cost of having children will jump exponentially in the coming years. How to have children or have more children? Will some smart scholar or academic come out with some brilliant idea to help Singapore and the citizens? "
"It's an easy answer. I am in my early 30s and we are supposed to have kids. But most of my friends are not having kids.

And of course the reason many of them state is, oh cost. But it's not that direct. Many of them are finally earning okay money, it's the first time they have money to spend to do things. People are travelling like crazy, they are buying houses that do not account for the cost of a baby. And because I was from the ""good"" Singapore path of jc to local big 3 uni, many are focusing of their careers or stuff like investments and FIRE.

Cost of living is a huge factor in all I listed. But really, even if the government subsidies the cost by let's say, 70%. I don't think that there would be that many more babies within my peers.its a phenomenon that happens in many educated cities. We are no different. It's a near impossible problem to fix honestly, and it's far more complicated than just cost of living or flexible work. It's easy to state the problems but the issue is the answer is very hard to reach."
Literally impossible for young people to live in Singapore without parents help. At least in other first world countries you can buy a home for 300-400k which is 4bedroom + garage over here can barely bto in 2 room
"I don’t think we need AI powered survey to point it out.. The high cost of living has been quite a serious issue for a few years now, and I feel its hard to live by without having to worry about finances even for ourselves."
"Not wanting kids due to financial constraints is a responsible and mature thing to do. Raising a child in Singapore is rough. Very rough 

A child is a commitment, not a trophy to show that you have ""reached yet another milestone"". People with this kind of immature thinking only treat their children as an extension of themselves, living vicariously through them. And worse still if they don't have the financial means. 

Or some people just feel that they are not emotionally ready for a child. I wish my own parents have that wisdom when they decided to have a child. They were both emotionally immatured and have a lot of mental health issues. If I am going to have a child, I need to work on my mental health first. This is also the sentiment many people in their 30s have. 

For me, it's financial and emotional. I adore children, and I have respect for peers who are parents. They are good parents with a healthy mindset. Not going to be one of these toxic people who thinks that having children is the worst thing ever.  It's not. I just think children deserves the best (:"
"It’s related but I would say the real number one is the unaffordability of homes. If HDB is minimum five-room flat and only cost $300k, then when newly weds tio BTO, by chance they will tend to fill up the spare rooms. Obviously make it cannot rent out also."
"What if I told you that, even if you have a million spare in your account right now, you would sooner spend it on ""investments"" than having kids?"
Are they conducting these surveys expecting a different answer so that they can gaslight us that it's our fault that the birthrate is falling?
"Of course cost is high, no thanks to parents too.
1. Buy expensive milk thinking without thinking why. E.g A made in Singapore premium milk is 40% cheaper in TW despite it is made in Singapore. Premium milk is twice the price here vs Australia.
2. Endless enrichment classes. I know parents who would spend 30% of their income to send kids to enrichment classes.
3. Choosing mind boggling private childcare over government funded childcare.

The list goes on."
"Cost of living is just an after the fact justification feels the most convenient and feeds into your own bias to chase material wealth. Provided amenities and real incomes have never been higher. Government support for couples and families bearing children has never been higher. Countries with higher birthrates have significantly lower real incomes and significantly less government support on a per capita basis. Cost of living is cope that hides the real problem, the cultural preference to chase status.

Status no longer comes from having and maintaining thriving families. It now comes from your job and your wealth. Children are seen as a detriment to this, so people choose spending time to further their careers and wealth over having a family. The only way to change the trend, is to change the basis of societal status."

"When one income is not enough to have kids that’s the issue. And let’s be honest if one of the parents stays home the career is strongly to heavily impacted. 
Make longer paternal leave lawful and compulsory for the employers and that might help?"
"37m with a 3yo child, have to disagree. Cost of living is not a barrier. In fact, having kids in Singapore costs less than having a child in other developed countries. 

 My family is a medium income family and we have no issues financially. The cost of children among the young adults is the perception of it due to ignorance. How many young adults know it costs you nothing from your pocket for your child's delivery and during and after pregnancy care? Even when you go private it costs you almost nothing? In 2021, my wife delivered our baby in a private hospital. We booked the most expensive package at Thompson and it only cost me $3k from our own money. In contrast, my home vacuum cleaner cost me $3.5k. I know the costs have gone up, but so is the payout. After three years, my child's CDA still have money left which we use whenever she gets sick or for dental. 

After that initial cost, having a child costs me around $300 a month (food, toys, clothes etc). Add nursery, around $900 a month. Once she is in school, then the cost will come down again to around $500 a month. If you're in a earning category who can't afford $500 a month, there are government programmes to help your child. Keeping that in mind, look out the windows at night and see how many cars are parked there. Each one costs around 2k a month or more. And at least in my HDB area, almost every car park is full at night. If you can afford a car, you can afford to have at least two children instead. And ten years later, you'll still have something left. It's a conscious choice to go for the car. And trying to find kids to play with my kid around our blocks, I believe there's way more cars than kids. 

The cost of living is just ignorance or just a convenient excuse. Or it's a lifestyle choice. In any case, those who want to have kids will have kids and continue on while those who don't get removed from the gene pool. There's no right or wrong to it as we are all free adults. But waiting on politicians to bring you utopia before having kids is not the right thing if you 'want' to have kids."
"pofma you ok, singapore doesnt have high cost of living if you live on a shoestring budget"
Once government succeeds in bringing the price of Chicken rice to $2 then we will have more kids.
The government will try some experiments with your Aging parents so you will have money to buy houses with insurance payouts. Life equates to money just like animals
Lol it's not high cost of living. It's not having a village to help out in raising kids.
"Though there r policies encouraging ppl to have more kids but then if you get pregnant too often and your boss/colleagues might not give you happy faces. Also if no helper or parents to help, no one to help when kids get sick, childcares have 8 closure dates every year as well, how to have kids or more kids."
"Solution pay the same salary package as what FT receives. Solved.

Typical package of an Indian FT is 13.5k. Check out Indians in Singapore FB page. They are discussing if 13.5k is enough for survival per month.

A typical Singaporeans slogging hard for 3.5k.

Downvote me if you disagree...i got nothing to loose...

"as long as 51% say everything's ok, that means no cost of living issues."
"That's just not really true though. Case in point the well off are also not having kids. People use that as a reason because its the most convinient excuse but once you really dive down to it, it's more a case of them not wanting a change in their current lifestyle."
"The truth is most people probably dont want kids these days, but is using the high cost of living to justify their choice."
Cost of living is indeed an issue but there’s also lifestyle inflation where ppl splurge on non essentials. It’s a lot more complicated than simply high cost of living
Because the cost of living not high to them
"That's because the people answering often do not really know why they are put off of having children. Cost of living, no money, is the easiest reason (or excuse?) to give.  

But if you look further, you'll find that majority who say so have not actually done any research and budgeting into the costs of having a baby and raising a child. And/or they think that their child will be left behind if they do not have access to expensive enrichment classes and tuition.

I don't think cost of living is the real reason, it's just the easiest thing to blame. There are definitely a lot of other factors at play, or else higher income couples would be having significantly more kids than low and mid-income couples."
Because the taxes go to their high salary
I don't understand how any loving parent can think it is okay to give birth to a kid who has to be put through a pressure cooker of a life.
"Yeah man... 

Not just about spending time, it's also about having the time to ensure the kids can have good nutritious meals too. 

1 hour really makes a big difference. If leave work sharp at 5pm, still can reach home in time to cook some simple dinner for the family. However, if leave work at 6-ish, reach home at 7+, by the time showered and everything, almost 8pm liao. Usually will be hungry af, no energy to do anything liao. Only option is to dabao. And, dabao outside stuff is usually unhealthy (heaps of useless carbs, oily, chocked full of processed/ultra-processed food, a few pieces of vegs and proteins only). 

Only way to either for the wife to not be employed / be a house-maker and take care of the kids or hire a helper. Both needs $$$ to tank, which drives up the cost of living, hahahah."
30% do not want kids at all. High cost or not.
"The objective of capitalist economy isn’t family. It’s economic activity and profits. Why not let one parent tend to the child especially in the child early years. Cos no economic activity. Better to get domestic helpers, form infant care and childcare centres to churn out economic activity."
"Thanks for stating the unfortunate truth which is that many of the child bearing generation just don't want to have kids, and aren't limited by financial costs as much as individual goals/gratification."
"and that is why the govt / society should stop forcing everyone to have kids through various ways. 

  
instead let those who want to have kids HAVE MORE KIDS. I have friends who stop at 2 coz of money constraints - they ill need a bigger HDB flat preferably jumbo, a bigger car, someone needs to stop working for a bit or both parents need to slow down in their career, someone needs to help kids with the homework. and help these people instead. right now, the policies are just to encourage people to have 1 kid but there isn't enough policies for those who want many kids. childcare leave for example, CDC vouchers."
"There are ways for this to be fixed, but none of them palatable It basically involves drastically increase taxes and offload all opportunity cost of having a child. This includes

1. Addressing time cost by mandating all people past some age (say 30) that do not have children must to mandatory community service of 20 hours per week helping those who do have 2+ children. I.e. Childcare, cleaning etc... all the stuff we presently offload to maids. \*This obligation cannot be bought out\* This balanced the opportunity cost sacrifice by not having children. So people without kids will not get advantage in promotions.
2. Mandate that all costs of children are subsides by state. This includes not only kindergarten/school but all associated extra costs of entertainment. E.g. Every adult ticket to \*anything\* (Theme Parks, Flights, etc) come with a government subsides free ticket for each child the adult has. Free hotel room upgrades/extra rooms for those who have children etc. This is course, involves drastically increasing taxes.
3. Mandate free housing subsidies/upgrades for those who have children. This means that having a child entitles you do apply for a HDB upgrade free of change (extra room per child).
4. Mandate that all cafes/diners/entertainment districts must cater for children (no child-free zones).  Mandate that all adult places where children cannot go (e.g. R18 movies, Bars) have complementary child-care attached.

These three policies will guarantee increased birthrates. But needless to say, no country has the political will to do something like this."
"The root of everything you just said is still money lol. Back then children were seen as a net positive to support the parents financially in their later years, even in poorer countries children were seen as net positive as workers. 

Nowadays having children literally affects your time, money subsequently your career negatively. Which is why they have lower societal value.

The root cause of why the govt wants the populace to have kids is exactly the same reason, money, to support the growing elderly population.

Korea has the same issue as us

>As a result, the proportion of low-income households dropped by 2.7 percentage points from 11.2% in 2010 to 8.5% in 2019. This means that out of 100 households that had children, less than 9 were low-income households. The proportion of middle-income households also fell from 42.5% to 37.0% during the same period.

>On the other hand, the proportion of high-income households increased by 8 percentage points from 46.5% to 54.5%. This means that out of 100 households that had children, the number of high-income households increased from 47 to 55.

>While analyzing this data, Professor Jeong said, ""As a result, it can be assumed that although this is an era where everyone is starting to not have children, the high-income class is still having children, the middle class is hesitating to have children, and the low-income class is starting to give up on having children altogether.""

And found that the high-income are still having children. It's the lower-income who have stopped."
"I’m in my early 30s, and many of my peers earn above the median salary. For us, the cost of living isn’t the sole issue when it comes to having children. It’s more about the lifestyle and priorities we’ve chosen.

We grew up without the chance to truly enjoy life, so now that we’re financially independent, we want to use our hard-earned money to experience life—traveling, pursuing hobbies, and simply enjoying freedom. For those who genuinely want children, they’ll find a way to have them, regardless of financial constraints.

Even if the government subsidized 50% of the costs, I’d still choose not to have a child. Raising a child is exhausting, and it leaves little room for personal pursuits. Reducing working hours wouldn’t help much either—free time would still be spent taking care of the child, not on personal growth or leisure. Traveling becomes more stressful than enjoyable when you have a child.

Hiring a helper might ease some of the burden, but it creates another issue—if the helper takes over most of the parenting responsibilities, then what’s the point? It feels like the essence of parenthood gets lost.

*refined my reply with chat gpt because my English sucks."
"Medium income family means roughly 11k household income? Bit hard to gauge without actual income numbers. I would also think that’s feasible for an average family (11k per month) quoting your monthly expenditures. In terms of base cost, the minimum is definitely what you have said. 

However, as Singaporeans, many peers with kids have quoted the need for more money to send their kids to enrichment, tuition and all the supplementary add-ons to have an edge over others (due to huge competition). This can result in costs many fold over what was mentioned above. My ex manager spends >60k per annum per kid on all these (she has 2), not accounting for living costs.

That’s for young kids, how about university? If your kid goes to exchange plus stay in hall plus allowance, that’s a good 100k per kid for the 4 years.

So yes, it’s cost but people are projecting higher costs because of higher expectations, not ignorance. That’s why with higher education and income there’s seemingly a drop in fertility rate. People want the same or better for their kids, and it costs a bomb today to do so. Incomes are not keeping up with inflation."
"When people talk about cost of living, it's not simply about the marginal cost of a child. It's the pressure for both parents to continue working full-time in order to keep up with costs (at least, without being significantly more frugal).
 
Outsourcing childcare to maid, grandparents or school is a poor substitute, but pretty much the only choice for the majority of folks who are not in industries known for disproportionately high salaries.

Doubly worse for those working in SMEs with meagre child-related leave/benefits."
"Well this survey is targeted at the younger crowd, which I'm presuming do not yet have kids.


Think the problem here is that they don't really have a good idea on how to guage the costs of living with kids. That is also exacerbated by the fact that a lot of them don't take into account the changes in lifestyle affecting their personal spending, and calculates the possible child spending stacking on top of their current spending.


Add on to social media amplifying their voices to each other and the story of 'unaffordable childrens' gets blown out of proportion. "
Because the cost of living is lower when you expect your children to work and fend for themselves as soon as legally possible.
"They do, it's smaller btos"
I was talking to a boomer on reddit.. he literally said its not that much different.. citing that it used to take 7 years of average salary to buy a house and now its only 10 years salary.. I mean like. Ello uncle.. that's a 40% increase you know right? Are you stupid?
"You, on the other hand, act like parents generally have sufficient retirement savings. *That* is not the norm at all."
"I find that a lot of the problems we face over here stem from our kanchiong kiasu working culture.


Take your end work at 5pm as an example. Why is it so prevalent that our 9-5 is actually 9-6? It's the companies that want a 9-6 working hours, presumably for competitiveness.


Another example is the vehicles on the road. Drivers kanchiong because they are short on time. This is in stark contrast with other countries. I've been to Japan recently and the drivers there really give way to pedestrians, with the same situation here we would see our drivers rushing 99% of the time. Rural areas or in Tokyo, the drivers give way, they don't rush.


Another example is the people here being impatient with staff, because of this kanchiong culture.


These are the examples that I have witnessed with my own two eyes. And I personally feel that putting too much importance on money/GDP comes at a cost, a cost that may become too great a price too ignore. It's a marathon and you cannot overexert for too long or you will fall and be left in the dust. Low birthrate is just a symptom of a bigger problem."
"it's literally just, ""Hey what if we did anonymous surveys, but like, for real?"" Kinda sad.

>Using an AI interviewing platform developed by US-based tech startup Listen Labs ([listenlabs.ai](https://listenlabs.ai/)), participants can share their candid opinions without social pressure or fear of judgment from a human interviewer, resulting in an unprecedented depth of authentic insights.  
  
Key findings from the study indicate that financial concerns are the top barrier to having children, with 70 per cent of respondents citing the high cost of living and the financial demands of raising a family in Singapore.              
  
**Mr James Breeze, CEO of Research Network,** said their innovative use of AI in research has demonstrated how researchers can conduct their studies rapidly, generating actionable findings within weeks, rather than several months with conventional telephone or face-to-face interviews.  
  
Prof Calvert added that using such an AI platform may eliminate social desirability bias, typically present in face-to-face interviews, where interviewees subconsciously reply in a manner they think would be more suitable or preferable by the interviewer.  
  
In contrast, having an AI ask questions using neutral sentences presented as text on a web app, and participants speaking in response, allows for a mirror-like experience where respondents feel more comfortable expressing their true feelings, similar to talking to themselves. "
"Weirdly they have fur kids so I don't think it's genuinely because they don't want kids. Pet hotels and vets are quite expensive in SG and they always buy expensive food for the pets too. Most say they dont have to care about schooling, that's the biggest difference. I guess everyone wants premium education..."
"Not sure what your point is. But are you telling me that 90% of the people, as long as the cost is okay will all go and give birth to more babies?

If you think that way, then I don't think there is much point in discussing this.

And using the word privileged is so odd to me. I am 99% sure I am nowhere near the top 10% in Singapore and most of my peers are not as well. We just went through the ""fast track"" in Singapore. So we are all doing well for ourselves but among uni Grad. I don't think we are anything that special."
At least over there you have the option to maybe live 45 minutes away and drive to work. Pretty common in US and Canada. In sg even in pungg bto is 400k
"If its all about money, that still doesn't explain why countries with significantly less wealth, less income, and higher proportion of their income being spent on daily necessities in the current day have larger families. On top of that, you then have to explain why countries that have the best financial supports in the world for families and children still don't see significant boosts in birth rates. Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, Iceland, Germany - None of these countries have birthrates reasonably close to the replacement rate. You simply can't do it with money, certainly not within a reasonable frame of reference.

With regards to your study, the biggest issue you have to wrap your head around is that the proportion of higher income families being represented in families having any children does NOT indicate higher incomes reach replacement rates. [Not to mention that this data is contradicted by other sources that show higher income earners having lower replacement rates than lower income earners in South Korea](https://www.kedglobal.com/culture-trends/newsView/ked202304180006). Even if this was somehow magically the case, you have to ask yourself if it even makes sense that an entire country can consist of household incomes above 300k purely to sustain birthrates (or alternatively, providing supports that represent up to 200-300k per year per family). At that point, the solution is clearly not more money, but something else.

You can see the same results being replicated in the US:

"$60k per year? Does she not understand that if she invests 50k a year for 18 years of the child, the child can retire at 18? Then the whole need to enrich is rather redundant? With moderate knowledge in the share market, with 10% growth per annum (low for moderately knowledgeable. Normal is 15-20%), the child will have $25m in shares by the tim they turn 18 lol. This is more a case of rich people feeling they need to rich everything in life because they are rich. Surely a parent who can afford $120k a month on kids knows enough maths and financial information to be able to do that right? Sounds like the kind of people who travel to Sri Lanka to eat the $15,000 desert which is nothing but some average chocolate with some average fruits from the local market with the only special thing being the ability to brag about it. My family is in Singapore median household income group. At least we were when my wife worked full time. Now she stays home to raise our child and work part time when I'm home. So we are bellow median household income. But we are comfortable financially due to our lifestyle."
"I'm not paid ridiculously. My total income would not exceed 7k a month. My wife doesn't earn much these days as she only works part time. She won't go full time until our kid in primary 1 at least. And I'm not sure if you'd rate my family frugal but this is how we live. My wife cooks most of our meals in my work days, and I cook during our off days. We both can cook rather well. We eat a balanced, varied diet and a lot of fruits. And we don't eat much processed foods. We only give organic food for the kid until she is at least 4 because we can afford it and to give her body enough time to develop. My daughter has her own common room for her toys, a room for her to sleep, and a room where my wife and I sleep.her play room is now stuffed full of toys.We are in the process of secretly removing older toys and donating them to make more space. She has 3 bicycles and one scooter. She has an entire floor to ceiling shelf full of children's books. She has a different table with three drawers full of arts and craft things which include painting stuff as well. We do go out to eat for special occasions but would rather prefer we cook ourselves because more often than not, we are disappointed by the food offered owing to our skill at cooking. It's a problem faced by people who can cook well. But we still do go out. We just started traveling overseas for holidays as now she is big enough to actually enjoy and learn. We will travel overseas twice a year for 10 days each trip. Every week, we go out to a new park in Singapore. And once a month we go to a place like the Zoo, bird park, Museum etc for the benefit of her and us as we enjoy them too. Every single day we take her out to play for at least two hours. If it isn't raining, then we play outdoors, if it is raining, then we play under the block. At home, my wife will sit down with the baby to do painting, arts and craft and learn the alphabet, counting etc for an hour or two (depending on her attention span). 

How do we afford to do all that? I don't know if we are special. I don't think or feel we are. I worked for 10 years (RP graduated) before we had our child and my wife worked for 5 years (NTU graduated). We first paid off all our debt except the mortgage which is serviced wholly by CPF contributions. My wife and I both never had any habit of buying luxury goods. For us, a converse bag for $50 is good enough. A good cotton on or Uniqlo tshirt for $20 is good enough. Everything we save at the end of the month, (and no, we don't count pennies whenever we buy something), we invest in shares. Sometimes we buy just 1 share. Sometimes we buy 10. We don't keep money in banks or in gold jewelry. My wife and I both hate wearing gold. Apart from our wedding rings, we don't wear any other form of jewellery. So our expenses there are zero. I do buy flowers for my wife once or twice a month if I see the flowers she likes. 

On top of that, I decided not to jump from job to job every few years. So I worked at the same company, the same department for the last 13 years. Owing to that, I managed to cultivate enough social connections that I can take a longer lunch break which I can spend with my family. I also bought the house right next to where my workplace is. So it's only a 10 min walk from work to home. I can also take time offs, easily take MCs and family care leaves with no questions asked as I am one of the most senior employees at work. Sure, I would have made another $1k, $2k more if I jumped around but I'd trade that for this freedom. 

I don't know if rest of the Singapore would rate us poor. And I don't really care. We never worry about money. We never look at a toy our baby wants and drag her away because we can't afford it. We never pick up a fruit and put it back down because we can't afford it. What matters is, we are comfortable and the future doesn't look bleak."
"Singapore income and fertility rate level is inverse. The lower the income the higher the fertility rate

A few factor
1)raising marriage age(BTO being one of the push factor) 

2)More choosing to remain single. Problem for a lot of men are they unable to meet local women expectation as women become more independent, they expect more from men. You will find this to be a major problem in East Asian society as men are expected to be the main bread winner. This does not happen so much in western society

3)Changing lifestyle translate to married couples not having or choose to have less children

While cost is a factor to having kids, it's actually really low on the list but usually gets blown up as the main reason"
"The financial incentives pales in comparison to the opportunity costs. It's a fact that careers suffer after having kids, especially for women. The gender pay gap is a gap between mothers and everyone else. The government's measly few thousands won't even make a dent in decades of lost/reduced income."
"Your answer reveals the real reason. Good enough is no longer good enough. It’s symptomatic of an unhappy childhood filled with a sense of competition, blaming your parents for not giving you a head start, and not wanting to have kids thinking that they’ll resent you unless you give them that head start.

I feel it’s something new and previous generations did not feel this way."
"No point to throw barely related American data at me, where there's no HDB/BTO system, the poor people are really poor, and people have children without being married.

In Singapore, this is the data. From 2013, so not the latest, but:

[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=1855576](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1855576)

>The relationship between fertility and household income is U-shaped: the relationship is negative for household incomes of up to $21,000 (in 2010 Singapore dollars) and positive for higher incomes.

The first time I read this, I thought it was $21000 annual income, in which case it would be true that more money = more children. But it's not.

>We find a U-shaped relationship between the two and the bottom of the U is reached when the household income is around S$21,000. This is consistent with the cross-country results in Myrskyla et al. (2009),who show that when the level of development of a country exceeds a certain threshold the fertility decline is reversed. However, there is a catch. The current median income in Singapore is roughly around S$5,500. It is just one-quarter of the threshold level of household income that our study identifies for fertility reversal. In other words, in the case of Singapore, the effect of higher income is likely to be negative on fertility for quite some time in the future.

In other words, unless the couple is very rich (>$21K monthly income back in 2013), the more they earned, the lower the fertility."
"It's better to look at what factors actually affect birthrate based on economic factors within a country itself rather then simply comparing to poorer countries where conditions are different tbh.

Example: Korea

>As a result, the proportion of low-income households dropped by 2.7 percentage points from 11.2% in 2010 to 8.5% in 2019. This means that out of 100 households that had children, less than 9 were low-income households. The proportion of middle-income households also fell from 42.5% to 37.0% during the same period.

>On the other hand, the proportion of high-income households increased by 8 percentage points from 46.5% to 54.5%. This means that out of 100 households that had children, the number of high-income households increased from 47 to 55.

>While analyzing this data, Professor Jeong said, ""As a result, it can be assumed that although this is an era where everyone is starting to not have children, the high-income class is still having children, the middle class is hesitating to have children, and the low-income class is starting to give up on having children altogether.""

Hmm their cost of living quite low 🤔 /s
"Well said on the kancheong kiasu mentality everywhere. 

About 9 - 6 for extra competitiveness, it only sounds and looks good on paper. Employees are humans after all and humans can get tired. Even with that 1 extra hour in office, it will really translate to more things done and more true productivity? Most times, people start to lose focus, get tired and just mentally zone out by 4pm++ at the latest, after that, it's just about scrolling phone, going toilet really slowly, waiting to go back. So it's really a big waste of a lot of people's time and lives here. Time that can be put to better use - like going for a workout or running errands or heading back to prep dinner etc. Intangible benefits that will actually improve yourself and your loved ones in the long run. And not just being an unseen cog fulfilling some weird robotic man-made requirement to stay ""competitive"". 

If an employee is truly productive, he/she can do that same task in lesser time. The problem here is show-face culture > actual tasks done. Work should be about clearing tasks, not clocking hours serving time at a desk, that's just plain dumb. But I guess management cannot wrap their heads around it, they like to see people sitting at their desks and will lose their marbles collectively if people can clear their work and ready to leave by early afternoon. 

Things are not that urgent for most jobs, you are not saving lives, most likely you are just replying emails and filling in excel sheets. People need that bigger perspective to chill out a little and live life a little. You only live once leh... Most Singaporeans need to get out there, travel more (beyond the touristy spots) and realise that life is so much more than BTO, CPF, cookie cutter malls, whatever official narrative they laid out for us. 

I guess we have been conditioned to think that we ALWAYS need to be HUNGRY and DO MORE DO FASTER (vis a vis the long-standing saying that if not, our jobs will go to FTs and now with the threat of AI), that we developed this tunnel vision that we need to cheong and cheong hard EVERYDAY, be willing to sacrifice, to prove our worth to stay in the job, to earn our spot so to speak. 

Therefore, this kancheong kiasu mentality seeping in every aspect of living. Before you know it, everyone is battling some form of burnout. It is just so tiring and draining and not sustainable for everyone in the long run, like what you said. Things won't be just about falling birthrates at that point... That's just the tip of the issue."
The pet situation confirms that it's not cost that is the factor. It's more likely due to the greater inconvenience on their existing lifestyle that having a child has. Dogs and cats do not demand nearly the same amount or type of responsibility.
">	There is no way to solve it while maintaining people’s personal freedoms and general social happiness.

Definitely. If the goal was to increase TFR at all costs, just follow in Somalia's example. It's proven to work after all."
"I'm not comparing who suffered worst and I don't deny the older generation suffered. I also don't deny being self-centered. So what? LOL 

Better than people who have a child and then don't spend proper time to take care of them. Older generation don't have the resources but keep churning out kids just to be their retirement plan? Yeah, definitely not self centered too :)"
"I think you may have missed out on saving for your own retirement, unless you are hoping for your kids to help in the financial aspects. Also, healthcare costs, housing costs have risen a lot lately. It’s also important to have a medical sinking funds. For some who bought their house earlier on, these costs may still be affordable, but definitely not now.

I have to admit we all make choices based on our priorities and have to give up some others. I don’t know how you can afford everything haha. And if yall didn’t had kids, yall would be living like way richer?

Just my 2 cents."
"Then the real reason would not be high cost of living, would it? It’s fear of being unable to compete in the workplace or having to take a step back in career.

This stems from a competitive atmosphere and workplaces rewarding instead of discouraging working OT and weekends."
"I feel @hakushaku view is legit tho. Every generation will push the boundaries, by rising to the challenge to provide the best resources and education for our own and for their own families.  Since the dawn of humanity, our minds have been wired for competition.  This drive remains in all of us, but we can’t afford to think in outdated ways if we were to live in the era of inflation, advanced tech and peer pressure where it’s an individualistic society, rather than an collective society."

"Another difference is them being status symbols. Dogs and cats, especially the rarer breeds, are a status symbol. Children are, in general, not. 

And using the money, time, and effort saved from not having children, you could put your pet in a fancy boarding house and go on your annual ski trip to Switzerland and still probably have time and money left for a trip to Japan. Would you rather spend your time teaching maths and the birds and the bees to a child? Or go skiing in Switzerland?"
"The thing is that its just not true that the Scandinavians are the least materialistic societies, at least not in a way that is fundamentally different from Singapore (or most other Western countries, for that matter). The core of the way status is driven in most western societies is the same, it comes from your job/profession. This is also generally true of Italy and Spain, all societies enforce some path for status, if you don't believe it is based on profession, I'd love to hear what you think it is, instead. When Scandinavian societies talk about passing policies to ensure women have equal representation in the highest status/income jobs, that in itself is a sign of the priorities of their countries. Corporate Gender Board quotas in Norway and Iceland, for example."
"Errr it's not that hard really. People look at the share market and think it's hard because they look at short term data. Look at long term data. When I started working for this semiconductor company, it's share price was $4.75 cents. I started investing a portion of my salary back then. People said semiconductor is very saturated don't waste your money. Now 13 year later it's $100 per share. That's 22x growth in 13 years. Why did I decide? Because it's America's only memory manufacturer at scale. Just like Singapore will never allow SIA to go bankrupt, America will never let it go bankrupt.  And this stock fluctuates by +-10 whenever our CEO publishes something online. I wait for it to dip go 90s and buy, wait for it to reach above 105 and sell. Did that four times this year lol. Do you think someone needs to be a genius to do that? All I do is track 5 companies in the field I work in since I know what's going on there. If you are educated enough to read quarterly reports, and subscribe to a few industry newsletters, it's not very difficult. There's a large amount of people who have do that. My own mentor, my senior at work, will retire next year at age 55. Was a technician his whole life. Invested well. Retiring with a fully paid EC and enough shares to never worry about money again.

It's like France is failing with a score of 40/100 and Singapore is failing with 15/100. Singapore is in a hopelessly bad state. The last time Sg had France's TFR was 30 years ago! We got here with the govt doing the least possible to support families over the years while the situation continues to get worse. Kinda like the current public housing situation.


We have so much to learn from France at improving our TFR. But looking at the progress (more like deterioration) Singapore has made over the years, I think we can already celebrate if we can match Japan's TFR. Matching France's TFR seems impossible."

Like have said elsewhere, if your only goal is to increase the TFR at all costs, we should follow Somalia's example and start a genocide and bomb our water supply. After all, their TFR is one of the highest in the world.

Now, I'm assuming you don't actually want to live in conditions similar to Niger or South Sudan where a major incentive to have children is to sell them off to the local warlord to ensure you can put bread on the table. The question now is how do we do it without the tradeoff?

France is absolutely not the answer, especially if you want to maintain the level of economic growth and culture that Singaporeans are addicted to. Go ahead. Try and impose laicite on the Muslims."
"It's not a guess that you do not understand. There is no other conclusion that can be made based on how you have replied.

So.. Singapore is doing terribly now and is expected to do much worse based on trajectory. Historically, Singapore has been terrible as well. It's just a constant decline thanks to zero effective intervention. Currently, France is doing much much better than Singapore. Based on their current trajectory, things would get worse but it could be 30 years later before they get to how badly Singapore has failed. Historically, France has been able to keep their TFR relatively flat unlike how it has been for Singapore. Singapore has zero success keeping it flat. Perhaps you shouldn't think of trajectory as something that's static."

GST hike did not ‘turbocharge’ inflation, says PM Wong as he acknowledged cost of living concerns

SINGAPORE - The GST increase did not lead to a “turbocharging” of inflation, said Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, noting that price increases moderated after the tax rate was raised in 2023 and 2024.

PM Wong was responding to Leader of the Opposition Pritam Singh, who questioned during the Budget debate why the Government had gone ahead to raise the goods and services tax, “thereby turbocharging inflation further”.

Inflation was driven primarily by global factors - war, supply chain disruptions and rising energy costs - and has since eased globally and in Singapore, the prime minister said on Feb 28.

He added that the Singapore’s central bank assessed the GST increase to have a “transitory” impact on inflation. The tax rate was raised from 7 per cent to 9 per cent in two stages, in 2023 and 2024.

Inflation peaked in 2022 at 6.1 per cent, he said. It moderated in 2023 to 4.8 per cent, before coming down further in 2024 to 2.4 per cent.

“Where is the turbocharging?” PM Wong said. “Look, I know elections are approaching, but this chamber is not an election rally. Let’s not get carried away by hyperbole and have a debate based on facts.”

The fact is that inflation has eased both globally and in Singapore, said PM Wong in his speech to round up the three-day debate on Budget 2025, which saw 57 MPs raise their concerns and suggestions.

The Finance Minister acknowledged that people are still concerned about cost pressures, and that it takes time to adjust to new price realities.

This concern is not unique to Singapore as it is felt across many other advanced economies where the headline economic indicators are positive but sentiments are poor, he added.

“We understand these concerns, and that’s why we are continuing to provide temporary help measures,” he said. These include more CDC vouchers and the voucher component in the SG60 package.

“We will continue to provide cost of living support for as long as needed, and within our means,” added PM Wong.

Addressing points raised by Workers’ Party and Progress Singapore Party (PSP) MPs, PM Wong said they “appear to be unhappy and displeased” that the Government is providing vouchers to help Singaporeans with cost of living.

“They suggest that the government is relying solely on vouchers to help with the cost of living, but we’ve never said that. These are temporary help measures. They are not long term solutions,” he said.

The cost-of-living measures and SG60 package account for about 5 per cent of the 2025 Budget, he noted.

A “much larger” part of the government’s spending is in structural programmes, in particular to equip and empower Singaporeans through education and skills and job training.

“As we have repeatedly emphasised, the more durable, the most sustainable way to tackle cost of living is to ensure that Singaporeans enjoy higher real incomes, and that must be supported by a strong economy and productivity gains. That remains the key thrust of our approach,” said PM Wong.

While Singapore has done relatively well, he acknowledged that the day-to-day lived realities for Singaporeans may be different.

This is why the Government has taken steps to strengthen the social support system as part of the Forward Singapore engagement exercise, to provide greater assurance to Singaporeans across every life stage, he said.

Rising social spending

PM Wong also responded to calls for the Government to make bolder moves on social policies, including PSP Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa’s point on the need to put more emphasis on social rather than economic considerations.

He said the government is prepared to spend more where necessary.

“But it’s equally, if not more, important to get the policies right and to ensure the overall system is fiscally sound and sustainable,” he said.

He noted that spending on social development is already more than what is spent on the economy and security combined - and is expected to continue growing in the coming years.

“Ultimately, a strong social support system should not be reliant on the government alone, even though the government is going to do more, but it cannot be reliant on the government alone. We will do more, but our actions must also be complemented by individual and community responsibility.”

The Government has taken steps to progressively strengthen the key pillars of Singapore’s social system and social compact, he added.

These include universal access to primary school, the CPF scheme for retirement, government subsidies for healthcare and the HDB system for housing.

“And we have progressively enhanced these pillars,” said PM Wong, pointing to schemes that target specific groups such as Workfare for lower-wage workers, Silver Support for vulnerable seniors and the broader SkillsFuture scheme for all workers.

Adjustments have been made over the years to continue providing assurance to Singaporeans, he noted.

For example, the CPF system - which turns 70 this year at a time when many pension systems in other countries are struggling with sustainability - allows Singaporeans to save for their own retirement with support from their employers.

Saving for retirement is not left to individuals alone, as families are encouraged to help their loved ones save more while the Government provides risk-free interest rates with extra interest for lower balances.

The Government will continue to review, fine-tune and improve the CPF system to better meet the needs of seniors and to prepare for a future with increased longevity and life expectancy, said PM Wong.

Other areas of social support the Government is looking into include for those with disabilities, caregivers as well as leave arrangements for families.

“We keep an open mind, and we study all your suggestions carefully and beyond ideas shared in this house, we continue to engage widely and hear views from all Singaporeans,” said PM Wong.

“We may not be able to implement every idea. There will be differences of views, and if we can’t implement it for whatever reason, we will explain why,” he said.

"What’s crazy is the big over the estimation of property tax collection recently. They under supplied hdb flats before Covid coz refuse to build ahead of demand causing all rentals to jack up a lot, increase prop tax in return then say they’re not part of COL increase? Hahahahaha"
GST hike was not the main engine of inflation but it sure did turbocharge it.
"Inflation is the rate of increase in prices for goods and services. It means that my dollar buys me less over time.

So you are telling me that by increasing GST, and doing it in a dumb way by spreading it out over 2 years and letting merchant increase their prices by over 40% or more, thus making my dollar worth less in two years than what it would usually take in about 8-10 years is not super charging it?

Why does our scholar government treat their people as dumdums?"
Just like how tariffs (another form of tax) have no impact on inflation right?
PM Wong: Increasing the price of Goods and Servicea did not increase the price of goods and services!
"When GST increase the businesses also increase accordingly at same time, so is not about global inflation. During 2021 and most of 2022 things were not so expensive. Early 2022 the first big change was taxi rates go up more than 30%."
"before gst 8 percent already rise andwards rise somemore,then 9 percent more excuse to rise and now everything is expensive but these ministers salaries.

"We import stuff. We pay GST when importing. This GST will be refunded. But refunding takes time. Our margin is low. What to do? We increase our price to defray the drop in margin. We take GST as part of our cost. If not, we can't survive. So you as a consumer is doubly charged for the increase."
Gst hike and their love for rent-seeking behaviour are the biggest culprits.
"It seems like every businessman including hawkers used the gst hike as the reason to increase their prices and we can't rebutt it because its true and factual. At the end of the day, the consumers/citizens are the one who suffer. And our employers didn't match a pay increase to our col increase right. But yeah, the gst hike was not the main reason because our pm said so. 🙄🙄🙄"
"Obliviously  GST hike caused inflation, cost of living increases"
"Must ask him and his team, so which factor turbocharges the inflation?"
Well well what would people think if he said the GST turbocharged the rise in prices?
"As much as I hate to say this, PM is right. And Opposition Party should be more precise with their terminology. It's fair that as a lawyer, Mr Pritam Singh is not well-versed with economic jargons. But it is also fair to expect a lawyer to be precise with his words. This could have been a very revealing debate.

More specifically, headline inflation is reported to be (5.0%, 4.3%, 2.7%) for years (2022, 2023, 2024). But if we look specifically at CPI for food, the numbers are (5.6% 5,8%, 2.7%). And if we look further at food court and coffee shop, we get (5.8%, 6.2%, 3.3%). Food prices in general has risen faster than reported inflation, and food court and coffee shop prices have risen even more rapidly.

To put those numbers into perspective, overall CPI in 2024 increased by 12.4% compared to 2021, Food CPI increased by 14.7%, and coffee shop prices CPI by 16.0% over the same period. I'd love to see data showing that this disproportionate increase is not due to profiteering from gst increases.

Any researchers in NUS, NTU or SMU who is up for it - would be nice to see data-driven reports on impact of gst on different CPI categories in Singapore. We should exclude categories where government have control over pricing (such as public transport, housing, and electricity)."

"But what do you expect, grocery prices to go down? That usually only happens in a recession. Best we can hope for is for our wage to catch up."
"Rate of increase drop means still increasing. If your salary never go up as much, then you have to fight for it. Upgrade yourself, take on more roles and responsibilities to justify the higher salary. You don’t like paying more for the same service, why would companies pay you more for doing the same thing?"
"> Somehow, Pritam Singh and WP have managed to set the narrative on the budget and PM Wong/ PAP are now trying to defend themselves. 

Reminds me of GE2020 where WP was said to be 'PAP-lite'.

Which in a sense had lent credence to the WP from the incumbent. 

No matter when people say WP is or isn't PAP-lite, the discussion alone forces people to compare the two party and treat them on equal standing."
"Rising prices are extremely unpopular to the surprise of no one. The optics of gst increase was terrible because it came at a time of high global inflation, and will be so easily used to blame the govt for rising cost of living. Of course opposition will capitalise on this"

No different from ""*Some of you may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing to make*""

Bloody tone deaf."
Wtf does take time to adjust to new price realities mean. High prices is high prices. Even if somehow the gst hike didn’t cause inflation the runaway inflation is still there.

I understand that the vouchers can be taken away anytime (eg next year budget may not give) so that creates anxiety when people think about the future. But IF (yes I know big if), the vouchers are confirmed for lifetime, does this change your view? "
Maybe…just maybe…the total extra gst collected is more than the value of all the voucher since gst apply to everything from daily essential to luxury? Just a possibility /s

Ya maybe if the world prices grow the business can try to absorb but world price increase+ hike x2 so many excuse for the business to increase price. Now it turns out the budget nv even need to use the gst collected for the last few years. He can’t dodge this epic fail.

Exactly. That’s why our cost of living remains high while inflation drops between 2023 and 2024 simply because the rate of increase of prices has slowed. 2023 was the year GST increased from 8 to 9%. :) I also think that he’s trying to avoid the real issue which is high cost of living and not just inflation.

Not talking about inflation bro. Debating if the GST hike increased inflation ***over and above*** than what would be an acceptable inflationary rate after accounting for the global inflation crisis.
Then wouldn't it be better to raise the income tax? GST is a regressive tax since low income group spend most of their disposable income on necessities.
And then we have Toast Box doing 5x 4% and still remaining popular. This GST turbocharging of inflation is debatable when weighed against the larger issues of inflation and profiteering.
"No. It was a budget debate and WP had every right to bring up what they saw as an issue with regard to gst hikes vs inflation. 

Lawrence on the other hand, didn't need to bring up GE in his rebuttal because that had nothing to do with a budget debate. 

Would Lawrence respond the way he did if there isn't a GE this year? Also don't forget that whether the GE is around the corner or many months away in end Dec, is largely decided by Lawrence himself. Hence, what he did was literally politicising an issue that he has 100% control whereas WP has none.

Finally, don't forget the primary role of any Parliament is to make laws, policies and review government finances. There was absolutely no need for any snide remark insinuating that the Oppositions had a political agenda when all they did were to scrutinise the government's budget, aka the role that they were supposed to do."
"My guess is they had the foresight to see the countries around the world are doing quantitative easing  during that period thus more money will be flowing and more economic activities, Singapore being a financial hub would benefit from this activity thus the increase to rake in additional revenue from this by implementing a GST hike.

"Dude really lucked out with his appointment to the covid MMTF, along with significant gaffes by the other 2 contenders (or 3 if you count Mr F. Populist). The stars really aligned for someone who wasn’t even in contention at the very beginning.

And all this in spite of his “meh” performance and avoidable fuckups in the MMTF (ie. playing the xenophobia card against Sinkies instead of temporarily closing borders to a certain country with an ongoing outbreak). Guess his rivals’ fuckups were even more severe in the eyes of senior party members. Well, good luck to us all as we usher in a new age of indecisiveness and gaslighting. Cheers y’all.

Oh before I forget, I wouldn’t even classify his decision to cull supply as a classic fuck-up on his part since it was definitely the intention of the govt to resume jacking up resale prices to appease Sinkie homeowners, esp after the overwhelming mandate the sheeple granted them in 2015. We really deserve the govt we vote for, eh? Fuck me."
Yes he said it's a stop gap until a more complete solution to the cost of living problem is found and implemented. So if the better solution is found and implement then the problem is solved right? If it's not then the vouchers remain. So either way it's a win-win for Singaporeans : either continue to receive vouchers or have this problem resolved. 
"Correct, it's debatable. There's no proof that the gst increase during a period of high inflation caused greater or lesser than proportionate increase in prices. Imo it's an interesting economic thought experiment, nothing more. Unfortunately it's now politicized.

RE toast box, they have the perogative to price however they like. Consumers have the perogative to patronise or not too. Ntuc too, though we note that it's ntuc fairprice, not ntuc cheapestprice"
">No. It was a budget debate and WP had every right to bring up what they saw as an issue with regard to gst hikes vs inflation.

I don't disagree.

But I'm saying PAP also has every right to always try to position themselves favorably politically in a debate like this.

They are all politicians. Politicians do politician stuff, and it's entirely up to the electorate to analyze the words that come out of their mouth on their own.

Agreeing or disagreeing with their stances or policies is a much more fruitful and important exercise than to gripe about them being politicians over their words.

>There was absolutely no need for any snide remark insinuating that the Oppositions had a political agenda when all they did were to scrutinise the government's budget, aka the role that they were supposed to do.

But hey, the role they are supposed to do IS political in nature, and doing their jobs IS a political agenda - their agenda is to position themselves as better alternatives to the incumbents and/or to be a form of check and balance.

The incumbents' reactions to this (bringing up the GE) IS also political in nature and serves their own political agenda too.

Which is my point. You can't look at politics like a gentlemen's sport. Once you think that one side is the honorable one just 'doing their jobs' and the other a conniving liar out to manipulate optics, you've fallen for the optic manipulation of the 'team' you are rooting for."
Was it a 2022 budget debate?
You still realise that both policies are interconnected to manage inflation right?
"This comment thread you’re in reminds me of the furore around the Australian Budget about a year back - the government insisted that overspending on specific items would actually bring inflation down at a quicker pace, and then supporters of higher spending gaslit critics into thinking that they don’t know how basic economics works (the decrease in inflation was arguably more of an accounting trick than anything)"
"Russia-Ukraine war played the biggest part in our inflation in the past few years, if we did not have the exchange policy we do, the inflation from war would have catapulted even further. Mind you, the inflation in 2022 was 6.1% which was before the gst increased to 8%. Correlation =/= Causation

">Gst and sales taxes, on the other hand, directly increase the prices of goods

Wrong, the tax doesn't affect the price level (what inflation describes) as it's applied to prices itself. Basic Economic theory states that over time, the quantity of money in circulation decreases as a result of the tax increase, therefore reducing inflation as there's less money chasing the same number of goods."

Are you aware the purpose of government? Lol I vote them to solve issue/lead country not other way around I have no choice but to raise gst so that resolve my fiscal problem.
"The reason MAS gave for strengthening our currency was to help cushion inflation due to factors such as the Russian-Ukraine war.

And like you mention had we not done it, I believe the inflation would be much higher too. 

However, we can all agree that GST does contributes to inflation even though majority of inflation comes from the world inflation, the question really is how much did it contribute?"
"I'm not sure which economics textbook you are using, but here's how the US Federal Reserves measures inflation: [https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research/inflation-101/what-is-inflation-technical](https://www.clevelandfed.org/center-for-inflation-research/inflation-101/what-is-inflation-technical) In particular, this para: ""Agencies use the basket to construct a price index. First, they determine the current value of the basket by calculating how much the basket would cost at today’s prices (multiplying each item’s quantity by its price today and summing up). Next, they determine the value of the basket by calculating how much the basket would cost in a **base period** (multiplying each item’s quantity by its base period price). The price index is then calculated as the ratio of the value of the basket at today’s prices to the value at the base period prices. There is an equivalent but sometimes more convenient formulation to construct a price index that assigns relative weights to the prices of items in the basket. In the case of a price index for consumers, statistical agencies derive the relative weights from consumers’ expenditure patterns using information from consumer surveys and business surveys."" It seems pretty clear that if you introduce GST after the base period, the ratio at today's prices to the base period will go up. 

As for taxes reducing money supply, that's on the assumption that the government doesn't increase its expenditure, or it chooses to invest the additional taxes overseas. Otherwise, the money goes back into circulation, just that it's channeled to other places.  The whole point of raising GST was to fund anticipated increase in government expenditure (aging population, baby bonus etc), so a large part of that money goes back to circulation, and giving out vouchers certainly means at least part of the GST taxes go back into circulation."

I'm curious what you think this word means?

And I'm not saying that. I'm saying having multiple parties debating and attacking/defending policies is a function of a democracy. No one's saying our system is perfect/full fledged.


>there's no need to protect them from the criticism they deserve.


Things are not black and white, truth VS lies here.


We the people have our perspectives on the GST hikes.


The incumbents have their own reasonings for the necessity of said hikes. 


Hence it's a debate, rather than a fact finding mission. If you disagree with their reasonings after they try to explain it, fair enough. 


But it's ridiculous to expect them to roll over and say ""Orh we shouldn't have done that"" if they genuinely think there are legitimate reasons they feel is defensible. "
"I’m also against raising of gst, but all I’m saying is that your comment isn’t very accurate to the context of Singapore."
">the point is people’s are asking why do you want increase gst at this junction when inflation is high

Maybe cos the country needs the increased revenue now? Covid expenditure resulted in deficits 

And is there any evidence that when or how they introduce the 2% gst increase affects the eventual price in, say, 5 years?"
"I’m not saying that GST does not contribute to inflation, I’m saying that you can’t place the factor on inflation solely on GST, which you agreed with. This basically contrasted what the original commenter said."
"Thanks for the great read. Just to clarify, GST can be both inflationary and anti-inflationary, however in the textbooks, its usually seen more  as a anti-inflationary to lower demand-pull inflation.  
  
Its actually normal that there will be one-time price increase due to transitionary inflation as Inflation is not a one-time thing, but rather the change of rate overtime. If the GST does not frequently increase, then it does not cause inflation in the long run.    
  
Here are some research papers supporting it as well.

It has been stated that there is a planned surplus of 6billion + for fy2025 as well. Therefore, its not an assumption to say that the government will not inject more money into the economy, as it has been told repeatedly that they are saving for rainy days. Hence, the way gst work in Singapore is more anti-inflationary in the long run.

I'm not supporting the notion that the GST is justified, but it should noted that after the initial price increase due to transitionary inflation, even after subsiding, the cost of living is still high due to price stickiness. I still think that PAP is severely out of touch with its citizens as they failed to realise that businesses will not be willing to lower prices."
Please read up MAS report GST increment affect “core inflation” before you comment.
"Problem with it is that the reasoning for the GST increment is never going to be a 'fact' thing, as there's projections for future spending and also saving for unexpected expenditure (like covid). 


Whether either numbers are 'sufficient' or not is always going to be a subjective thing. A conservative person might think $70 billion (example) is more than enough for both reasons, whilst another might think we will need at least $100 billion (eg). 


There's no way we can factually determine if projected spending is accurate for something that will occur in the future, so it's literally all by estimates. And you'll have to listen to their explanation on how they came up with those estimates and determine if you agree or not."

The PAP aren't stupid. They've been paying attention to the news and for all the rumours last year about an impending GE, 2024 came and went just like that. It's clear they are waiting for global economic trends to improve before calling the GE so they won't have to suffer the kind of losses incumbent governments suffered all across the world last year. This survey makes it clear the way Singaporeans vote won't be an exception.

But they can't put it off forever. If cost of living and unemployment issues persist, the opposition could stand to make big gains hammering the PAP on these very issues, even though these issues at the mercy of forces beyond the control of the government. Most of the electorate won't care that the government can only do so much to control inflation. And reports of the GDP and economy improving certainly won't sway minds.

As an American comedian puts it: ""Average Americans are getting screwed, and they are suffering. And you cannot argue with that by showing them a stat. Because suffering is a feeling, and feelings are real. Ben Shapiro actually has it backwards. Feelings don't care about your facts. If you tell someone in pain that they shouldn't feel so bad, they say 'fuck you' and they go to the next guy."""
"Here's an alternative headline: ""High cost of living exacerbated by the PAP-led government's consecutive 1% GST increases, 3 in 4 voters likely forgot this key issue"""
"We need to do a way better job trying to make Singapore self-sustaining. Dependence on foreign investment destroys any control we have over things, including prices of essential goods and services.

I don’t think people realise how deep a hole our forefathers have put us in. The current government has no plan except for creating skilled labour to work for foreign companies that settle down here, which doesn’t solve the problem."
"All ministers sacrifice their bonus for this year, cut their salary by 30% and give every eligible voters $20k cash not vouchers not rebate not useless skillsfuture credits or NS credits, cash only. We sure vote for PAP. But the ministers will dare to do this? 

No lah they will only come out with useless plans and tell you they will address COL and whatever issues, after election slap you guys with more things to take more money back. 

Sinkies time to wake the fuck up or continue living poor and suffer in this rising inflation and COL country, continue to lose your jobs to foreigners and please don’t kpkb so much on internet because you voted for your own government."

"Title: Cost of living tops Singaporeans' concerns ahead of GE, 1 in 4 voters undecided on who to support: Survey 

Article keywords: Singaporeans, cost, living, election, survey

The mood of this article is: Good (sentiment value of 0.12)

SINGAPORE: The cost of living has emerged as the top concern of Singaporeans heading into this year’s general election, for which over a quarter have not yet made up their minds on who they will be voting for, a new survey has found.

Concerns over jobs and unemployment came in second, while the state of the economy followed in third place, according to the study by Blackbox Research’s SensingSG, Singapore’s only public and independent sentiment tracker.

Released on Thursday (Jan 16), the survey was done earlier this month and involved 1,310 Singaporeans eligible to vote in this year’s electoral contest, varied by ethnicity, age, gender, housing type and region to represent national demographics.

The next general election must be held by Nov 23 this year. It will be Singapore’s 14th since independence, and the first under the country’s fourth-generation leadership led by Prime Minister Lawrence Wong.

“Despite all the media noise surrounding politicians in 2024, our findings highlight that Singaporeans are prioritising practical, everyday issues over everything else,” said Blackbox Research founder and CEO David Black.

He noted that factors such as tangible improvements in local government services and the cost of living are at the front of mind of the electorate.

“As we edge closer to GE2025, it’s clear that voters are more focused on their own balance sheets than they are on any wider themes,” said Mr Black.

this is one of the root cause of all. why bring them in when in the end after they open offices here, they highly pay their own people here instead and only a small percentage of locals get some benefits. More locals are given contractual roles instead with no stability and the perm staffs are converted to contract roles are let go early even before retirement age. I haven't even include those rentrenchment exercise by them.


We must rely on ourselves, keep importing those FT or depending on foreign investment will screw us up soon. This is not about being natives or what, it's about common sense. There must be check and balance in importing the right people and businesses. BTW, US is changing boss ar.."
"If there’s one thing I picked up from other elections around the world last year, is that vibes are way more important to how people vote than actual statistics. 

Comparatively we’ve actually done quite well over the past few years. While other countries are facing huge inflation and unable to bring it to the 2% goal, we’re pretty much on track to hit it this year. Hell, even the US can’t seem to bring it below 2.5%.

But do people care? No, not really. Can you blame them though? Also not really. The opinion is that prices have risen too fast, and like a lot of other countries there’s a tendency to just blame the incumbent party and vote for the alternative. Who cares that inflation is back to normal levels? What people are focused on is the now. What they’re going to be paying for groceries and their houses this month. It’ll take a while before wage growth helps to negate the effects of the past 2 years or so of a high inflation environment. 

Is the PAP going to win? Yeah lol, not even a real question. Are they going to win comfortably (over 70% of the popular vote)? Ehh, I have my doubts."
"Curious - who do you think should not deserve our support?

The recent issues in memory -

1. PSP-PAP fight in Gombak - Low Yen Ling and Tan Cheng Bock
2. Ridout GCB (against backdrop of rising cost of living and $88 million recorded sale) - Shanmugam
3. MRT breakdowns - Chee Hong Tat
4. Iswaran scandal, TCJ affair, Nicole Seah affair - PAP and WP leadership in general
5. Pritam Singh trial and Raeesah COI- Pritam Singh and Edwin Tong"
"Hdbs and btos are not allowed for foreigners and pr right?

I assume you mean they bought resale?"
That would be in the multiples of median salary.
"I recall my own mother telling me that I better vote for PAP, I told her what she was doing is illegal.

Unfortunately, in the current political scene, we are mostly caught between a rock and a hard place. A lot of the impactful individuals we know of that time just don't exist today."
"Yes, we planted money trees so our future children could sit in the shade. 


However, now there are holes in the fences, and neighbours who instead of planting their own trees at home (1000+ times the size of SG), decided to pick the fruits off of your parent's trees. "
It has definitely increased. At least 10% of the population had bought HDB during the exorbitant levels and are residing in them while struggling to pay.
"In a sense, the PAP also enjoys one of the highest vote-to-seat disproportionality in the world and higher compared to the 3 countries, where they could win 100% of cabinet and 100% of parliament even though less than 70% Singaporeans voted for them, starving the opposition of oxygen in terms of exposure and recruitment successes.

This partly accounts for their longevity because the more diminished the alternative, the more likely voters will be forgiving towards their only option.

And although someone here argued that nothing else matters as long as PAP wins a majority of votes and seats to govern, the reality is different.

This is because the bastion of the ruling party lies in the executive branch while the bastion of the opposition is in the legislative branch, so the latter needs to be sizeable in the legislative to stand a chance to present themselves as an alternative.

Shadow cabinets are vested by parliament from among parliamentarians, not a separate cabinet that receives authority approval to exist. If the opposition wins no seats despite getting 40% in every constituency, it won't be able to form a shadow cabinet."
"Gain political goodwill and make the future sinkies pay for it.


Sounds like privatising the profits and socialising the costs. "
"And practically, it's likely to be held in May/June. After Budget, and during school holidays."
"I don't think we can draw a conclusion like that..the established opposition of the WP is in pretty much total organisational disarray given the spate of scandals and it really hasn't been able to move past it's old PAP-lite branding. Like James Lim and all have been decent parliamentarians but there''s no real breakout moment.  The rest of the opposition is the SDP that though it does articulate a coherent alternative with the establishment of a social democracy is ultimately still too much of a one man show. The PSP is simply an even more milequoast version of the pap-lite that seems to exist only from a personal falling out, if I wanted it why not just vote for the original. The rest of the opposition are just vanity parities.

And traditionally singaporean voters tend to flock towards the PAP in times of economic crises like in the election after the asian financial crisis. If the Trump Tariffs do get put into place, well it's looking like an extremely hard period that'll cause people to flock towards the incumbent for some sort of stability in a chaotic world."
That’s a false dichotomy - cost of living and political stability are not mutually exclusive - instability can significantly push up inflation.
"Actually, the term swing voters is a commonly used term and is typical of most elections. In fact, politicians spend the most time and effort trying to win votes from this group. With regards to the numbers, yeah it's debatable, but the concept is well known."
"6. Allianz Income saga - PAP and NG Chee Meng

7. No conclusive evidence to suggest ride-hail operators will drive up COE prices - Amy Khor

8. ACRA NRIC leak and subsequent cover up - Jo Teo

9. 6.9mil population and growing - PAP in general

First one pisses me the most. It's the clearest evidence to date that shows the PAP   has no qualms selling the country out at the expense of its citizens."
They are tried and tested . Boomers vote for them due to lots of benefits they get + rising property prices which indirectly fund their retirement;)
Why is that so ? Once these cost increases are covered it shouldn’t be a big problem ? After all median wages of Singaporeans are increasing yearly ? ;)
">it feels like any wealth that has been generated in the past few years has not been directed to the people who need it most.

I think most people around the world would agree with you. And because it's a global trend, I doubt it matters much which party is in charge here. Realistically, what could the WP / PSP / SDP etc have done differently? Maybe postpone the GST hike, or give out even more vouchers? I don't recall any solid proposals from them that would be obviously better at tackling the rising cost of living, than what the govt is already doing.

The PAP hasn't done themselves any favours either by scoring own goals (the Allianz deal, the NRIC saga, SMRT train breakdowns)."

Like i said individual MP can be progressive. PAP and WP has no interest in Culture War.

Why is trans issues foreign issue? Singapore and Bugis' infamous history paint a different story tho. "
"They are not PAPs money.

Edit: to add, using government budget to issue annual vouchers that does not disclosed public data on how much is spent and on what and how much is unspent and where is the unspent money is never a good idea. Also issuing such vouchers only causes impulse spending and also increases the cost itself. Fundamental problem is not solved.

Is the same logic online shop charges seller fees, seller mark up the price even more regularly, then even more cuz the shop issue vouchers."
"Yes it is a stop gap measure, It does help to a certain degree for sure. 

But I do not agree to jacking up 2% gst during the toughest times, where inflationary pressure were at its highest. It further added financial stress to people, which could be totally avoided."
"I don't know if it's comparable to 15 years ago but I see lots of foreigners, mainly china,  everywhere I go. Like I go to the mall and I'm sure to hear at least some + working at the shops. Are we going to different places?"

They've reform the BTO system to get rid of the worst abuse, moved towards formal anti-discrimination laws, gotten rid of the criminalisation of gay sex and generally held the ship steady.

It's not been perfect but I'd give it a solid b +"
"Exactly, they tax you only to give you back a small cut and say we help you. Don’t bloody increase gst in the first place. Or better yet, don’t be bloody lazy to work out a tier based taxation that lower tax on essential daily items like groceries and increase for luxury goods."
"NRF/TIS was so good for Singapore's tech ecosystem, because it meant startup companies had the money to hire good people from the Bay Area, many whom actually pass their knowledge on to locals.

Singapore's tech community has been much poorer in recent years since foreign labour is hired largely for cost rather than experience."
"Yes, I do agree with you. Was more describing the current state of affairs as opposed to what I think it should be. 

Succinctly put by JFK - “Those who make peaceful revolution impossible, make violent revolution inevitable”

Even more succinctly worded by Malcolm X - “ballots or bullets”

Personally I do not see violent revolution as necessary as of now. As much as the PAP does tend to push for methods that disproportionately favour themselves, the elections held here are not fraudulent or sham elections. They still have well over the required 50% of the popular vote for effective control over the government with a voter participation of >90%. If this changes, so will my opinion, of course.

I do have gripes with some ways that they handle policies: drunk driving minimum sentences, misuse of TT tokens, housing price cooling measures that aren’t aggressive enough, to name a few. But I think overall they did an okay job given the circumstances over the past decade or so, and at the same time I will still vote for whoever is more in line with my personal beliefs. I don’t ever expect politicians or political parties to perfectly align with what I believe in, to do so would be a foolish endeavour."
"Yes that’s their point but the financial burden on the rich as compared to the poor is vastly different. For a person making $20000 a month, a $200 more is just 1% of his/her income, while a person making $2000, that’s 10%. Same amount $200. That’s why the less well off are feeling the heat much more than those who are wealthy. 

Gst tax everyone the same rate per dollar of spending. The financial burden on the less well off will be much higher."
"I was about to say that maybe the government was trying to target tourists, then I realised:

The huge number of tourists who buy luxury goods in Singapore get to happily claim refunds on GST, so the financial burden ends up being largely on Singapore residents.

PAP really didn't think this through."
"Yeah and I don’t think there are a lot of tourist buying it luxury goods either as our currency is relatively strong. There’s Japan with the weaker currency and a 10% tax refund. 

Their main argument is that it’s a fair tax for consumption but that is only true if you are view it as a dollar spent. However, in reality as everyone has different income, so to apply this justification of it being a fair taxation is not right."
"Once you get on the loan treadmill, you're done and bankruptcy beckons.

Singapore is becoming more divided every day. You have people who can't feed themselves and then you have an army of kids spending $30 in the latest brunch spot for coffee and some Eggs Benedict."
"I saw alot of uncaring comments on the CNA FB post.

But the reality is that any of these things can happen to anyone:

1) turn 40 and suddenly become replaceable with a cheaper foreigner

2) have an illness that affects your health

3) being beset with caregiving responsibilities

Your options become very limited.

Yes, you do your best to try to catch up. But costs of living rise up faster than your ability to earn.

And when you are mentally fatigued, physically tired - you just want to solve the problem fast.

quote from article:
“Additionally, Mr Ng and other delivery riders noted that they often have no choice but to take jobs that appear unreasonable, because rejecting these jobs can result in them not qualifying for incentives set by the delivery firms. 

Mr Ng gave an example of a friend who had to make several trips to and from a supermarket to deliver more than 10 cartons of water because he was unable to safely load all of it on his motorbike in one trip. 

“We use all that time and risk our safety just for S$5,” he said.“"
"Cost of living cannot be solved unless there is broad based growth in real income, or property prices coming down so that rents too can. 

This problem was caused by the sharp increase in sg population post covid, when the world was already facing inflation from suppressed demand, and the gst highly likely exacerbated it.

This was the PAPs doing and they need to find a solution quickly."
"I’d like to see how the government will explain this problem away and say 1) there is no cost of living crisis, 2) this is due to the platform workers not upskilling so this is their fault.  You see some of these comments on CNA’s post on FB."
"wtf, I did not realise that Grab was a moneylender:

>For Mr Fadli, his loans came from ride-hailing firm Grab's financing programme. Launched in 2023, the Partner Cash Advance programme provides loans of up to S$10,000 for private-hire drivers and delivery riders under Grab's platform. 

>The programme is open to active driver-partners and delivery-partners who have driven with Grab for at least three months, have average monthly earnings of at least S$1,000 and have met Grab’s internal credit risk assessments.

(...)

>In response to CNA TODAY's queries on the demand and take-up rate of Grab's Partner Cash Advance programme, the company did not provide data, but stated that it was part of broader partner welfare efforts to help its partners have better access to credit for managing cash-flow needs.

Other loan sources exist that aren't Grab. Isn't this just Grab's way of profiting off of their own drivers' cost of living issues? Issues that Grab itself is partly responsible for?"
"When everybody is tightening their purse strings, you can't expect people to spend more on food delivery and private hire. Just look at the amount of unhired taxis and PHV reported in the past few months.

These gig workers are trapped by their own thinking that the gig economy will last from the rise during covid."
Can those debt offset by CDC vouchers? hearsay is offset living cost 🤡
"Grab will use all data collect to maximise its own profits. And since it’s rev share to platform workers are a cost to itself, it’s no brainwr that platform workers will be squeezed dry."
"The root of the problem is not enough full time jobs for locals. More help must be given to people who have lost their jobs. I agree to comments that platform jobs are really meant as temporary jobs or extra income to tide you over. 

The govt has proposed CPF for Platform workers to make it seem that these jobs can be made full time. Instead, govt should make enough jobs for our locals rather than focus to make platform jobs full time."
Not to mention people who think $5 hawker food is affordable and tell you it is normal to spend $18 on pasta meals.
Can’t imagine anyone disagreeing with you but the stoma guy in the article did try to find other jobs more suitable for his condition.  Others are single parents so they probably needed the flexibility in hours
"My guess is more along the lines of how personal expenses is a choice and they can always choose to spend within their means. 

Personally, I find myself taking ride-sharing and ordering food delivery a lot less these days (in part because they seem so expensive). That has always been my key misgiving regarding these gig platforms - how sustainable is it to do this in the long run?"

"If you think $5 is too much, how do you expect hawkers to make a living these days?

Ironically, most hawkers are part of that lower-income group that require everyone of us who are more fortunate to be more comfortable with paying more for hawker food to help lift their incomes (notwithstanding more assistance for the government to manage rents and provide other kind of social support).

Can't have it both ways. The Nordic countries have low inequality and that's also reflected in how their F&B businesses, waiters and cooks all can be paid very well with high food prices and their society is willing to accept that. Everyone who is doing more well-off must be either prepared to cook at home or pay $25 for pasta so that the waiters and cooks get their fair share."
"The problem isn’t that consumers aren’t willing to pay more, but that the excess is often skimmed off by these very companies. Just think - there’s a delivery fee, a platform fee, they still get 25% of the cost of the order, and how much that actually goes to the person delivering the food to your doorstep? And companies like grab and foodpanda still have the cheek to ask me whether I want to tip them. 

Like - where is all the money going?!?"

Honestly a lot of pasta you buy outside can taste that it's made with sauce from a jar. For that price can feed a mini army already at home.
"The reason there is a huge price difference between ulu and heartland areas compared to the city area is rent. 

It's a dirty word cause local landlords here cannot accept they are part of the problem. And everyone wants to be a landlord.

Higher profits just leads to higher profits that's it. Hoping for the trickle down of it leading to better wages is weird tbh when our unions are worthless and there's a steady source of cheaper workers from surrounding countries. The pressure is not there.

This continuous blame game between everyday consumers and small businesses is incredibly dumb tbh as the rich just watch and laugh."
"Hawker rentals are heavily subsidized, can't compare them to coffee shop or restaurant rentals."
">If you think $5 is too much, how do you expect hawkers to make a living these days?

 

Why not ask, how would the poorest 20% of working households think? I'm specifically comparing to the lowest 20% because that's a key target of cheap hawker food.

We can't rob the poor to save the poor.

Especially if you want to compare with Nordic countries, why not compare a bit more?

Norwegians spends less on food and have more time. 21.4% vs 26.6% on food and dining services. They work average 36.9 hours/week (2023, settled working hours, 30-54 YO, excl. immigrants), vs ours at 43.3 hours!

They can go home and cook. Assuming 5-day week, they have 1.28 hours more each day! We also spend a lot more time on commuting vs them.

Norwegians also have pensions. They get around $1689 a month, for life! To get that much from CPF LIFE, you need $308,900 in your CPF! Healthcare is capped there, so they don't blow life savings on healthcare. The Norwegians can spend without too much worry, even for the poor. *Try doing that in Singapore*.

Our poor already earns more than the equivalent poorest Norwegians, even *after* taking home 20% less of what I quoted above if you assume highest CPF rates (worse case, not even a fully realistic assumption)!

You are expecting 2 hands to clap and you only want to provide the 1 hand (high prices) but not the other (low cost of living relative to income, more free time, and spending security).

**I'm not saying we cannot do more for hawkers.** If we want to progress and make everyone secure and prosperous, then let's start with having social safety net from poverty and spending security, and decent work-life balance, then sure, we can have Nordic level of pricing for eat-out food.

It's clear if we advocate for Nordic pricing now, what we get is oppression of the poor. And not to mention I'm not even entirely convinced how landlords can't leech off.

One last thing, if hawker food becomes very expensive, there will be far less demand for hawker food. Many hawkers will go out of business.

Questionable benefit and yet many people are made worse off. Who wins?

Norway's low wealth inequality isn't because of high prices for dine-in food, it's because of the social policies. *Everything I mentioned above, even if it's a bit tangential, adds up!*"
"'It's one banana, Michael. What could it cost, $10?'

"There’s no price difference. My workplace in ulu Jurong cost 5-6 bucks , other than mbs , the entire sg price is normalised "
"Nobody is comparing them to coffee shop or restaurant rentals. It's a very simple question - for an average hawker who charges $5 for their food in a subsidised hawker centre, how much do you think he is earning? how much do you think his food assistant/cook is earning? 

Odds are they are making less than the average or median Singaporean (especially on a per hours basis), and if we really want a more equal society, anyone who is earning more than them must be prepared and willing to pay more than $5 for hawker food (or indirectly through taxes). That's literally what being equal means."
"While I mostly agree with your points, I just have two things to add w.r.t their fiscal policies.

Norway is rich because of oil. Their pension fund is the world's biggest and *every Norwegian citizen* has a stake of approximately 438,000 SGD in the fund. And it keeps growing and the oil keeps flowing. As big as GIC and Temasek is, or as big as our reserves are, we do not have the fiscal position of the Norges bank.

To put in perspective, their pension fund alone holds 1.5% of *all the world's listed companies*. 

That is not to excuse Singapore not spending more on social programs. We are currently running a surplus after all. We have the fiscal position to spend on more social policies. And I think we should. At the same time, we do not have the same context as the Norwegians w.r.t Oil and the level of material wealth. 

The second thing is their defense policy. They used to rely on NATO given that they are a founding member. Trump has changed it all up and now there is an EU wide push to rearm. Norway has consistently spent below the 2% target only reaching 2% during covid. The push for defence spending is going to eat into their fiscal position."
"It's very telling that as a society we think the poor need cheap hawker food.

"More expensive food?! No way! Hawkers should know their place in society!!!(/s)

It's a losing battle every time I argue this. The next thing they will tell you is govt need to subsidise rental, govt need to bring food prices down blah blah. They don't care as long as they don't pay. Hawkers can make peanuts for all  they care"
We can do so by cutting rents. Land should be free for all citizens.
"This. Norway has certain advantages that many countries (and definitely Singapore) can only dream of. Having oil reserves goes very far, especially if you manage it properly. Singapore has some advantages too, of course, but they pale in comparison.

Also, Norway paying below their ""fair"" share for defence is very real, at least until recently. While in Singapore we round up our local males and tax 2 years of their lives away, on top of an extremely high defence spending."
"This take is painfully **oversimplified** and cherry-picks examples to fit a narrative while ignoring the full picture. Let’s break it down.

First, saying **“Capitalism (with strong institutions) is working”** is redundant. **Of course, capitalism works when it has strong institutions**—that’s like saying **“cars (with good roads and maintenance) are working.”** The real question is whether capitalism inherently leads to strong institutions, and history shows that’s not always the case.

Now, let’s look at the **cherry-picked examples:**

* **China’s Reform and Opening-Up** → Yes, China embraced market reforms, but it did so under **state-controlled capitalism**, not the free-market model you’re implying. The government still plays a massive role in the economy, directing resources and maintaining control over key industries. If anything, China proves that **capitalism without strong state intervention is unstable**.
* **Nordic Model** → The Nordic countries are **not** purely capitalist. They have **high taxes, strong social safety nets, and extensive state involvement** in key sectors like healthcare and education. If anything, they prove that **regulated capitalism with socialist elements works best**—not the unregulated capitalism that free-market extremists love to push.
* **Post-Soviet Eastern Europe & Baltics** → While some countries like Estonia succeeded, many others suffered massive economic **shock therapy disasters** in the 1990s. Russia’s transition led to **oligarchic capitalism, corruption, and economic collapse**, proving that capitalism without strong institutions can easily go off the rails. Even in the Baltics, the 2008 financial crisis hit them **harder than most of Europe** due to their rapid privatization.
* **Cuba** → Yes, Cuba struggles economically, but it also has been under a **decades-long US embargo** that has crippled its trade and financial access. If you’re going to compare economic models fairly, you have to account for **external pressures**, not just internal policy choices.

The argument is self-defeating because **every single ""successful"" example relied on strong state intervention** rather than pure capitalism. The real takeaway isn’t **“capitalism works”** but rather **“a balanced mix of capitalism and state regulation works”**.

If anything, this take shows a **lack of deeper analysis** and an overreliance on buzzwords rather than real economic understanding."
"? My point is that income has increased faster than inflation. Singaporeans are in a better position than 5 years ago. This is not bad, considering we had COVID-19 pandemic and the following surge in inflation."
Don’t advance them. That’s it. Tell them it’s company policy that we don’t do salary advances.
"Bro come on.
Advancing salary != BNPL business model that incurs fees and interest.

Also this bullshit is done in other countries and paid for through welfare. I don’t think Singapore should entertain it."
"Although I don't really like the way you replied to others, but... Honestly it's the truth, as a worker u will seek way to get the additional money no matter what to pay for your expenses, if grab salary advance didn't exist, they wil justl seek other means (bank, loanshark)

The money has to come from somewhere, understandably theres conflict of interest of having your loan come from the same source as your income, imo it's way better than depriving them of this option and forcing them to use more desperate measures"
"I mean, what's the point of the arguments here anyway? 

Businesses will set prices that fit them.

Some set high prices but ulu so there is still business.
Some set low prices even in ulu but no business cause they suck.

Some set high prices but also have high volume of sales as they are popular.
Some set low prices and a have high volume of sales.

Some set high prices but low volume of sales as they suck 
Some set low prices but still have low volume of sales as they suck.

Not all hawkers are the same.

Plenty of high-end restaurants fail also, even the celeb ones."

It's oversimplified because I don't have the energy to argue with someone over established economics. It's like saying the demand curve is oversimplified because veblen goods exist.

No. That's not the real question here. The real question here is your original comment:

The inverse of capitalism has never *ever* worked.

The question of institutions has been settled by last year's Economics Nobel.

"Wait till you have guys coming to you, the Boss, asking for x3, x4 advance salary.  
Then you tell me what kind of ""safeguards"" you will put in, in order to protect the Company's interest? Yes?

Do you think Grab did this altruistically and started offering such ""loans"" - one fine day, out of the blue? For the Greater Good of their employee's well-being?

Welfare... yes, how? Talk is cheap, as I said. WWYD? You haven't answered my question.

Again, I am not defending Grab, but I already said clearly: Demand must always be there first before supply comes along. I have worked in companies where:

1. The employment contract form you fill in on your 1st day has such a question: Which Holiday would you like to receive advance salary for (You may tick more than 1 box)?
2. The salary for that month is credited on the last workday day of the month. This means sometimes it comes in on the 28th, sometimes 29th, sometimes 30th, sometimes 31st.
3. Some asshole guy receives his salary for the month (paid out in the first few days of the calendar month) - and then goes AWOL and closes out his bank account to prevent the company from recovering that month's salary.

It's points #2 and #3 that really opens your eyes to the real corporate world, and then you realise there's a reason for point #1 to be there...

Now, WWYD?"
"Thanks for your response.

I don't work for Grab, and I don't use their products/services much either... and while I understand this loan thing is going to attract all the brickbats, I can't really say much against it because it is what the people want.

While everyone says it's ""predatory"" and taking advantage of the  workers who are already in a financially vulnerable position - nobody bothered to read the details in the sense that there are criteria that Grab sets before they disburse the loans to the worker guys.

Just sick and tired of people who rant and complain all day about social issues, but they say ""it's not my problem"" when I ask them ""What would you do differently to make it better?"""
"I actually agree on his response because if you consider foreign workers working here, can their wages really sustain in Singapore with both feet on the ground?

This is how the G-man road map works - Every few years a new and upcoming industry pop up, they want us to be software engineers, Bankers, Data analyst and so on. 

Then those industries that are really fundamental to our society such as plumbers and ACMV & drivers they tender out to the lowest bidder. And because we don't have minimum wage back then Singaporeans realised the pay cannot sustain the high cost of living obviously they ain't going to apply. So instead of supply & demand coming in and say, ""Let's increase drivers pay to attract more locals"", the G-man instead be like ""More foreigners to come in to cover skills gap"". I find that's the method to try and get Singaporeans to indirectly go up the income ladder.

This Grab rider debt issue is no different. In the beginning locals and make a career out of it. Then allowances and benefits gets, you now see unauthorised foreigners doing the jobs, including those like Lalamove. Inflation and cost increase, but why are drivers struggling? Condos are costing freaking millions, and the supply and demand law should make Security guards quite well to do folks, but why they still need Wage Supplement Scheme?"

Right. Except that's not what you said from the start. You said, very clearly, that:

""Time for us to reflect and rethink whether Capitalism is actually working.""

Then now you're backtracking? Keep in mind, the Nordic Model, Reform and Opening Up, Ordoliberalism, etc are all variants of capitalism! Ordoliberalism is literally called *Rhine Capitalism*.

Also as a tangent, any debate requires you to give a definition of capitalism (as well as capitalism prime - let's just denote it as C and C' for ease of future reference). Since you didn't it requires me to tiptoe and try to guess what your definition of capitalism is, and so far, it seems to be more of a normative vague changeable thing rather than an actual defined concept, given how you advocate for the overthrow of capitalism only to go back and defend what is quite literally called ""Rhine Capitalism""

">	Oh wow, so now formatting and AI accusations are your entire argument? 

You see the crux of the issue here? A few sentences telling you to correct your formatting to make it more legible isn't ""making it my entire argument"" but according to you, it is. All I want is for you make it easier for me to read your comment so I can understand it better, but unfortunately in your little brain, telling you that you have poor diction and formatting is somehow making it ""my entire argument"".

That makes it so incredibly hard to talk to you when you just have this level of disingenuous line of thinking. You have just an astonishingly shit level of epistemics. So according to you, I can never tell you to correct your shit formatting because that would mean I'm suddenly making it my entire argument?

Are you that triggered by someone calling you out on your diction and style that you seemingly think so highly of?

>	You can’t counter what I’m saying, 

Did you literally not read any of my counters? Are you illiterate? 

>	so you’re hyper-fixating on bold letters

Because they're annoying and making it hard to read.

>	If my arguments were actually weak, you’d be tearing them apart instead of whining about my writing style.

*I did tear your arguments apart*.

Also, those two things aren't mutually exclusive. You are creating a false dichotomy. Again go back to how fallacious your logic is. You can both tear a person's argument *and*, as the cherry on top, tell a person to use proper legible formatting.

>	You’re just throwing around AI detector nonsense

Right. So you refuse to admit that you use AI to write you comments (plural, because I'm also referring to your comment history in other comment chains and where there is a clear distinction between your natural writing and AI generated comments).

See, in Philosophical Logic from Popper, we learn that in order to test something, it must be falsifiable. Since you clearly do not accept and admit that you used AI, and there is no method by which we can both agree to *test* that for that falsifiability, thus this line of dialogue is fruitless. Especially for a layman in AI like you.

What I say however is that AI detectors aren't nonsense. I could go on to talk about fingerprinting, how LLMs over w.r.t MLPs, transformers, probability distributions + AI Safety, etc, but I sincerely doubt you understand any of that and the underlying math. So what I will do is leave you to read up on it.

>	which, by the way, flags anything remotely coherent as A

No. This is objectively false.

You seem to think that AI detectors will flag as AI anything that's well-written or ""coherent"", Etc. This is false. That is not how AI detectors work and I can mathematically prove it via pattern recognition, fingerprinting, and by borrowing approaches from linguistics to identify repeated structures. 

If anything, AI detectors flag out unnatural badly-written speech rather than coherent ""well-written"" speech.

>	This is just a lazy cop-out.

Partially Correct. It is a laziness but it is not a cop-out. Why should I explain it when I'm just copying pasting what's written in *Why Nations Fail*? All I have to do is direct you to it. And since you clearly know how to use AI, ask gpt to summarise AJR's work.

>	If it’s so “established,” then explain it instead of expecting everyone to just accept your vague assertions.

If are having a debate about quantum mechanics, do I need to first establish everything down from Newtonian Mechanics? Why is it my responsibility to account for your ignorance?

I expect someone who wants to debate economics to already know who won last year's Nobel. I expect someone who wants to debate capitalism to know what Ordoliberalism or what the Permanent Income Hypothesis is (and ideally be able to derive it mathematically). It is stupid to want to cover Econs 201 material and then be angry when Econs 101 knowledge is assumed to be a prerequisite.

>	The inverse of capitalism has never ever worked.” → What even is the inverse of capitalism? This person refuses to define their terms. 

Keep in mind that ***you*** are the one who first used the word capitalism. You are the one refusing to define what capitalism is. Surely by ""this person"" you're referring to yourself?

When I talk about capitalism, I'm talking about the accepted working definition in Economics. The one you find on Wikipedia and in textbooks. An umbrella definition that covers everything from Laissez-faire to MMT (again, if you don't know what MMT is, it's a mark on your ignorance and go read up on it) and Social Democracy and even elements of Democratic Socialism. 

>	But capitalism without regulations and strong institutions has also failed repeatedly (see: financial crashes, wealth inequality, monopolies choking competition). The most successful economies are mixed economies, not pure free-market capitalism.

Again, I will point out the irony of you being against ""Capitalism"" (a vague nebulous term that you have not defined and that I have no idea what your definition is) whilst simultaneously arguing for Rhine Capitalism (Ordoliberalism, etc).

So you're.... Pro-capitalism? Or anti? Or what? What's your definition here

>	First off, name the actual prize winner instead of being vague.

Are you stupid? Like genuinely? I've named them like multiple times - AJR!

Literally anyone who is in the field recognises them. Hell, the moment I mention institutions any student of economics should have their names pop up already in their head given their immense popularity in the field.

>	But that does not prove that unregulated capitalism is the best system.

And who is arguing for unregulated capitalism exactly? Or is your definition of capitalism laissez-faire capitalism? So you exclude Rhine Capitalism from the definition of capitalism?

>	This is laughably false. Economics is filled with debates—monetary policy, fiscal policy, taxation, trade, welfare models, etc. If economists didn’t debate, we wouldn’t have different schools of economic thought. 

Look. I know I'm talking to a proud dunning-kruger ignoramus here, but do me a favour and look up the IGMChiacgo database.

Again, I find myself repeating **over and over and over and over again**. Just because physicists debate over quantum mechanics does not mean that gravity does not exist. Yes, Economics is filled with debate. Every field is. If a field has no debate, it wouldn't be staffed and researched anymore in academia because there is no incentive.

But what I said is true (again you have a habit of trying to create false dichotomies when none exists - That's not how proof by contradiction works). Economists debate less than you think because a lot of basic fundamental issues (especially inconsequential normative stuff like how to define capitalism) has been settled.

What is being debated, especially in places like NBER (if you don't already know what NBER is before commenting on the state of economics as an academic field, then you're proving my point about your ignorance and dunning-kruger) is the specific models and underlying mathematics. The neoclassical synthesis has been concluded.

>	What alternatives to capitalism are you talking about?” → Again, a misrepresentation. The point isn’t replacing capitalism but rather improving it with better regulations and social policies. Saying, “Oh, so you want communism?” is a strawman argument. No one is saying capitalism should be scrapped entirely, but rather that it should be structured in a way that benefits more people instead of just the wealthiest.

You literally started out by saying we should rethink capitalism. So how was I supposed to interpret that? You are obviously advocating for C' (please go back to see the notation system in my previous comment). Whatever C' (Capitalism prime/inverse) is left undefined *by you*.

I have no idea what you might mean by C'. I didn't say communism at all. You are trying to push for me to say it so that you can label it as a strawman argument but I have never even used the word ""communism"" except when quoting you.

>	that’s failed in most cases. 

It failed in *every* case.

>	No one is saying capitalism should be scrapped entirely, but rather that it should be structured in a way that benefits more people instead of just the wealthiest.

So.... Rhine Capitalism? 

>	Because it’s a lazy reference. If they’re talking about an Economics Nobel, just say the name and the findings instead of expecting people to look it up. 

Why? I expect you to already know who AJR is when you debate Economic! I don't expect you to even look it up. I expect you to already know.

*Why Nations Fail* is literally freshman year assigned reading!

Also poor epistemics. Saying that ""it's a lazy reference"" does not refute the point that it's a ""vague"" reference. The reference is clear. Even if it were a ""lazy reference"", it was still a ""clear"" one.

>Also, not everyone follows the Nobel prizes religiously, so assuming “Oh, everyone should just know what I’m referring to” is arrogant and lazy.

"The general public needs to understand that vouchers benefit the government more than it does to you.

The government will never give cash, as people would save/ invest for themselves. On the contrary, a voucher with an expiry date needs to be used, and more often than not, you'll top up cash out of your own pocket to make up for the price differences. You have to remember that all these vouchers, used with our taxpayers' money, is probably just a fraction of the extra 1-2% of GST that the govt has earned over the last two years - there is no such thing free meal in this country.

It's all framed to ""help you"" afford essentials and ease your cost of living, but if you dig deeper they're actually strategies to (1) further boost our economy through extra cash spending and (2) convince the voucher loving crowd that they've just been handed ""free"" money once again.

">the government would just raise taxes and hoard the money for no reason

Well, not for no reason. Unlike the private sector where success is measured by profits, in the public sector it is measured by activity - more programmes, more staff and more funding. There is thus an incentive for government to capture an ever increasing share of the national income even when it may not be neccessary as they are not constrained by a ""bottom line"".

Issue is not just property tax, just taxing more of those who own more than 1 property (aka those buying house for investment purposes). Those living in landed properties (excluding those older kinds where is small in size e.g Joo Chiat, etc.) should be paying more in terms of estate taxes.

Most Singaporeans only own 1 property, which is their HDB. Some of them rent out their houses whilst living with parents that 1 I can understand.

Alot of people are unable to afford a house and have no choice but to live with own family/siblings, etc. Also, the rental market is spiraling out of control too.

  
Government should put in more measures on those who simply buy properties for investment purposes, these are the real contributors to our housing prize at the moment. Alot of UNHWs come here to park their money, and a convenient way for them is via real estate speculation."
Yeah because it's an inflationary action
"In the end, the question that always has to be asked before any form of tax is if it is necessary to the function of the government. We should never implement tax as a measure to ""make people pay their fair share"", but rather as a way to ""fund necessary government functions"".

The whole wealth tax argument is an alternative to GST in search of a need, and the US is flipping the table on this narrative entirely. We ought to be very careful with the assumption that we need more taxes at all."
"GST in and off itself IS a regressive tax. A flat tax is the very definition of a regressive tax. 

Also, WP have talked about the implementation of wealth taxes since as far back as 2021. It has even been published by the MSM so please at least do the bare minimum research.

https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/politics/parliament-wp-mp-jamus-lim-proposes-wealth-tax-of-05-to-2-per-cent-on-the-richest"
What about those with foreign spouse (non pr)? Also only can apply for 2 room flexi BTO. 😭
And they still spend multipliers more than the middle and lower income households combined.
"Ministry of Finance:

Tourists and foreigners residing in Singapore accounted for around 50% of GST, while top 20% of resident households accounted for close to 20%.

So 50+20=70% and this is for top 20% of resident households. I'm slightly extrapolating to include the top 50% to cater for 80% of GST."
"I didn't say GST isn't regressive by nature. I said it is not regressive in the SG context. 2 very different things.

For the wealth tax, I apologise for missing it out in 2021. The proposal still seems to remain the same in their current manifesto, which I have explained why it is a stupid tax."
"Nope. But it's better to increase GST and redistribute money to the targeted groups, then solely rely on increasing wealth taxes."
"Sure lets create an unreasonable ruling

Only when you have kids within 3 years, you keep the flat. Otherwise hdb reclaims it.

And my question still remains, why does a single need more space? Dont throw rhetorical questions because there is no valid answers"
"Guy is the kind of person that thinks hospital, polis, hdb, roads, etc all drop from the sky"
Or there are other more efficient means to capture taxes from these uhnwi that doesn't require such hoops which obfuscates the actual resource reallocation and also raises inflation.
"Social assistance.  Which we already have.  
https://www.msf.gov.sg/what-we-do/comcare 

Middle class don't get assistance but we feel the inflationary pressures."
"It IS a regressive tax regardless of context.

You’re talking about a separate policy that aims to deal with the problems of it being a regressive tax, which I will argue is an imperfect solution. 

I’ve explained this in another comment, but the GST vouchers are a good example of how stupid this is. We give them to people based on income, but this includes people that are wealthy, with low income. We also do not give them to the middle class, who are of average income, with differing levels of wealth. 

Shan’s argument sounds convincing on the surface but you need to look deeper."
"Because if they die die want to live in SG they have to pay?


There are other reasons more than money for the ultra rich to reside in Singapore, such as safety, stability, and protection of assets from governments like the CCP. 


But there is only so much more they are willing to pay before they think it's not worth it. Most countries already charge property tax, so it's not a huge difference whether they settle here or in Switzerland, but if we are the only ones with a wealth tax then they would be hit so much harder and start to consider moving elsewhere.


So I suppose the balance is taxing them as much as possible without scaring them away, which right now the govt thinks is GST+ABSD"
"There is a corporate sales tax in America, it's at least 21%.  
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corporate_tax_in_the_United_States  

It's not that they don't pay sales tax, they get tax breaks from them, u get them too via income tax deductible.  You have an issue with that?  

If you say tax laws have too many loopholes yeah, possibly,  
But that is distinct from them not having any sales tax which is untrue at all.  

If u say ""GST good, tax them all equally"", then yeah Tesla already has that.  What happens after is government goes ""here we reducing your taxes because u poor thing u make so much losses previously"".  Which is the same idea as the CDC vouchers now."
"Which is offset by prices going up correlated to the amount given back, aka inflation."
"There is not foolproof way of helping society at this juncture without affecting prices at all. Unless your proposition is to cancel vouchers permanently, which I bet my left nut PAP will lose the next election confirm."
"I will paste what I wrote here a few days back

GST exemptions on necessities sound appealing in theory, but they don't quite add up in practice. Let's break it down into two parts: implementation costs and actual benefits.

Implementation costs would be substantial. Defining what constitutes a ""necessity"" is a challenge, as evidenced by numerous court cases in other countries debating whether specific products qualify. For instance, a UK case argued whether a food item was a biscuit or a cake, with tax implications. 

Administering such a system would require significant taxpayer funding to establish a department to categorize every item sold in Singapore. Additional tax audits would be necessary to ensure accurate reporting, incurring more administrative and legal costs.

Now, let's examine the benefits. If we exempt GST on necessities, three groups would benefit: low-income citizens, higher-income citizens, and non-citizens (which is approx 2.4 million people). All would save on GST, regardless of their financial situation.

In contrast, our current GSTV scheme targets support specifically at low-income citizens, providing them with more substantial assistance. To illustrate, if all three groups pay $10 in GST, exempting necessities would save each group $10. However, our current system collects $30 and redistributes it to the poor, providing more meaningful support.

Given the costs and inefficiencies, GST exemptions on necessities seem like a costly and ineffective solution. Our current system is more targeted and beneficial to those who need it most."
"I admit I'm not familiar with estate taxes so can't comment on that.

How would capital gains tax work? If you're taxing profits from stocks, there's many easy ways to avoid it.

I still don't see what's the issue with raising GST. Low middle income families will get back what they paid, and more."
"Oh there is.  Currently we have no vacancy tax for example, a property owner who leaves their property unoccupied will pay no less than having it occupied.  

So they will rather sit on it than lower rents.  
Leaving us all worst off,  
1. Businesses having to manage an ever increasing rent costs.  
2. Unoptimal resource maximization in a land starved country.  

Or next, estate and capital gains taxes.  


So yes there are ways."
"That’s a weird take tbh. Do you know our inflation calculations already use a basket of essential goods? We don’t need an all new department for this.

Leakage to the rich is fine, as long as everyone else is covered. The rich aren’t spending a majority of their income on essentials, the rest of us are. I mentioned how inefficient retribution via subsidies are so I won’t repeat that - but tldr the middle class and even some of the poor get shafted."
"These aren’t new concepts. You can study how they’ve been implemented in other countries. 

The issue is that it is a regressive tax. Subsidies and handouts aim to solve the problems of a regressive tax by redistributing the gains, but this only works if implementation is perfect, which it isn’t.

Let’s use gst vouchers, for example. The lower income get them, which is good. But what about the middle class? Also, what about those that have high wealth but low income? Should they be entitled to the vouchers? (PS: they get them under the current system)."
"Yea.. you clearly have no idea what any of these are of course your opinions are going to weird....

Sales tax are exchanged at the point of sale. This means when the tax is charged the transaction will be taxed. How much of it is bore by producer vs consumer is based on the price elascity of said goods and services (see link)

https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/microeconomics/elasticity-tutorial/price-elasticity-tutorial/a/elasticity-and-tax-incidence#:~:text=The%20tax%20incidence%20depends%20on,the%20demand%20and%20supply%20are.

Corporate tax is based on declared profit by the company. 

Do you see the difference?

Corporate tax is so easy to dodge. You can manipulate your profit margins and claim plenty of deductibles Thats why all these big firms gets away with paying fuck all. And it's all legal!

Its very hard to legally manipulate income... unless you are going to straight out put fake numbers... The GST is charged at the point of sale.

So if your goal is to stop tax dodgers... you would employ sales tax (or gst or revenue tax or VAT whatever the country calls it)

This has been the trend around the world. As tax dodging gets more sophisticated, corporate tax rate has fallen whilst sales tax has risen. You can do your own research on this.

Again. I imploy you to use your brain. If gst/vat/sales tax etc are so unpopular and vote losers.. and the laymen voters are just asking to increase corporate tax.. why don't democratic govts of the world just do it? Are they stupid? Do they hate votes so much? Are all these economists and financial experts employed by govt agencies retarded?

Or maybe . Just maybe.. you are not seeing the whole picture."
"Do you know i worked in the tax field for 10 over years. It's not a weird take. It's something that happened all over the world  

You are not OK with gstv accidentally giving some of the wealthier ones, yet you are OK with the wealtheir getting benefit from the exemption when that money can be redirected to the poor. If you choose to be ignorant, we can just agree to disagree here."
"Capital gains tax will result in capital flight. The lack of it is why we have high inflow of capital way above our weight. 

GST vouchers are basically used to ""nullify"" the cost of GST these 1-2 years. And even in this model, there's already a distribution of money from the rich to the poor. 

Example. Poor spends 1000 on goods and services, paying 100 tax. Medium income spends 5000, paying 500. Rich spends 21000, paying 2100. Total tax = 2700. It's divided into 3 parts. Each person gets back 900 dollars. 

The poor and medium income benefit, while the rich lose out. So even if tax revenue is distributed evenly, it's still progressive. So I don't get the ""regressive"" narrative. In reality, low income families get way more than they pay in taxes. 

When GST vouchers are stopped and revenue distribution becomes more targeted, it'll become even more progressive."
"Because if u buy a Tesla u already pay a sales tax.  
https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/sales-tax-calculated-based-on-tesla-center-location-instead-of-my-registration-address.321849/  

the transaction IS taxed so I have no idea why you are saying its not.  Where are you getting that the transaction of a Tesla car being bought or sold is untaxed?   

It's pretty hard to answer when you are partially coherent and kinda all over the place."
"Yeah, that's the point of taxes right?  
To pay for social benefits.  

if your point is only about social benefits, I don't understand why you think helping people only entails raising of prices of those goods or services.  

When you say no foolproof way, is there an established methodology u base it on, or did pap say that?"
"Sure, then you should know that we already have a department that determines our basket of essential goods.

Look, if you’re going to be uncharitable, let me simplify it for you.

Our current tax system burdens the poor proportionally more than the rich. Our measures to fix the problems of our tax system via means tested redistributive measures are imperfect, and lead to the middle class and some of the poor missing out. 

Hence, we need an entirely new system of taxation based on both wealth and income."
"There’s much more to why we have a high inflow of capital. If you simply think it’s because we’re a tax haven, you’re sorely mistaken - that’s an extremely unsustainable model.

You’re talking about two different things. GST is a regressive tax - we’ve already established that.

The vouchers are a way to undo the damage of the regressive tax. This is an entirely different policy that requires means testing an redistribution. Do you know how we assess who gets what? We look at household type and annual income, which leaves out swaths of people that don’t meet the criteria. It’s inefficient, and an unnecessary process that does nothing  but puts the incumbents names on our money."
"Sales tax is different from US state to state. Some have some don't have. Its not fixed at federal level.

Look. I dunnoe wad your you are trying to make here.. because my point is without sales taxes.... corporations don't pay tax. And you are telling me.. ""ya.. correct. Tesla pay sales tax in some states."" So we agreed? Sales tax are a nessesary evil?"
"Our current tax system burdens the poor more proportionally than the rich? Proof?

Currently, every dollar of taxes, the bottom 40% paid, they get back 4 dollars in benefit. The middle 20s get back 2 dollars, the next 20% gets back 1 dollars while the top 20% gets back 30 cents. You want to spread misinformation, at least do your homework.

And the basket of essentials for CPI doesn't matter for GST. No one is fighting to be in the basket of items. Once you exempt, everyone will claim they are cakes, not biscuits, if one is essentials one isn't. Why? Will you be more likely to buy something that is 10 dollars or 10.90? It's common sense."
"It's not the only reason, but one of the key reasons.

How is it extremely unsustainable? We are doing great so far.

We've already established how GST leads to progressive outcomes so that's settled. 

You're now moving onto a different point. You say it's inefficient. So how would you propose redistribution to work? What is your more efficient method of redistribution?"
"I see we’ve reached the stage where you’re intentionally misinterpreting things.

Let me simplify this for you.

GST is a regressive tax. This is not debatable - flat taxes are regressive.

Redistributive measures aim to solve the problems of it being regressive. 

Your argument is that the redistribution achieves the effect of making the system progressive. 

My argument is that it doesn’t, because of the inefficiencies.

I would prefer that our system of taxation doesn’t require corrective measures."
"You're missing the point.

There's 2 parts: taxation and redistribution.

There are different taxation methods.  GST is the most efficient and broadest way of generating taxes. Income taxes target the higher incomes, but  too much and high net worth individuals will flee. Same as wealth taxes. 

Singapore's economic strategy as a small country is to attract capital inflow. That's why we keep our income taxes low at the highest bracket. GST is the most efficient method in increasing revenue.

You will say, but it's regressive! That brings us to the second point - redistribution.

With redistribution, the effects of GST are progressive, as I've explain in my example.

The issue is that you see redistribution as a corrective measure to a shitty tax system. After all, if you collect taxes only from the rich, then there's no need for redistribution. But this is dumb, because you'll cause capital flight. There's a reason why countries all over the world implement GST/consumption tax. And what kind of tax system are you designing such that zero redistribution is needed? It doesn't exist.

Again, what's your proposal for redistribution? You mention a lot of issues with the current situation, with income/household parameters etc. But you still haven't proposed a solution."
"Food price is lesser concern, I would say for a first world country our food price is relatively cheap. It just feel that it crept up too fast post pandemic.

One thing that is very problematic is housing/rental prices. It went up significantly after pandemic that a lot of businesses can’t keep up, and I don’t think our government are focusing on this at all. Why your food cost went up by a lot also because of this."
"Food is honestly not expensive in Singapore especially eating out at hawker centres/coffee shops. Don't compare with JB or some emerging market pls the salaries and cost structure is so different. Go to any other developed city and you can see for yourself how expensive it is to dine out. As a percentage of income, we are probably close to one of the lowest in terms of percentage of income spent on food (statisticians pls step in). 

With that being said more support from the government should be in place to ensure everyone can afford to get good nutrition. Some people are still falling through the cracks and we need to do everything we can to help them"
"$10 for food at a major metropolitan city is objectively affordable. 

Tip is to make sure your salary increases with inflation. On average it does, but this is the average and there are people who get left behind. In which case, you either have to negotiate or (more effectively) job hop"
"The whole world is experiencing higher cost of living, inflation and rising food prices... not just Singapore. Hopefully you know that. If other countries increase their prices, it affects prices in Singapore too. A lot of people don't understand how global economies work... Tbh, Singapore is doing much better controlling the costs than other major countries."
"What a joke.. I just had a $4 chicken rice near Geylang East Activesg swimming pool and it's near Aljunied mrt.

Swimming pool cost is $1.00.


In JB, chicken rice now is >RM7 and swimming pool was already >RM10 even 10 years ago. Mind you their salary is dollar per dollar compared to us. You earn $3K, they earn RM3k too

CBD salary is higher than other places just like how KL is more expensive than other states in Johor. Naturally the price, due to rental etc follows. And pretty sure >80% CBD salary is higher than other places."
"It’s not just Singapore, prices have gone up everywhere"
"It depends on how much you earn. 

To some it's just cutting down 1 cup of Starbucks a week, others might be cutting down 1 meal for few days a month. 

I did opt for McDonald's saver meal sometimes because it's not easy to find anything less than $7 in some places I work at. Ironic because my parents used to say ""So rich ah!?"" whenever they see me eating McDonald's. 

But the downside of eating McDonald's saver meal is ... you'll probably not be full for long enough, which means you might get supper."
"This is a global thing, this cost of living crisis is not isolated to just Singapore. Covid got the ball rolling and all the wars and other factors contributed to the snowball.

You can try meal prepping, buying essentials in the monthly online sales those double digit ones like 4.4. 5.5 6.6."
"Im answering in relation to your complaints on food prices.

There's always cheaper food options. You're just paying for the convinience. I set aside a budget of $100/month for work lunch. But most of the time I average to $80. Never buy drinks since company has a free vending machine for juices or coffee.

We have a tool called budgetgowhere that allows you to find cheapest food options wherever you're at. I mix it up by bringing some homecook sides.  Some boiled eggs and air fryer chicken nuggets with my $3.5 chicken rice. But I'm someone that can eat the same meal everyday and not get bored of it. Most people I know can't live this way.

Some days I being leftovers from zichar dinner the night before.

7-11 haa quite a few meals that taste decent. Even if somehow the cheapest option is your subway set,  there's always meal preps.

You could also probably try switching up your diet plan. Maybe have a heavier breakfast/dinner and light snack for work lunch. I have no problems skippinng lunch if Im going splurge a restaraunt for dinner or even go for a 24hours water fast for health benefits. Intuitive eating is a whole other topic for another discussion.

The knowledge is out there. It's up to you to use it or not."
What's really needed are rent control laws - something to set the limit on rent increases between tenants and lease renewals. But this is difficult while the government remains committed to selling their idea of getting onto the property ladder and into property investments as a means of asset enhancement. Which they won't because they need asset enhancement measures to account for the fact that CPF returns have not matched or outpaced COL increases due to our fast growth.
Food prices are still okay. It’s just that they are not healthy as compared to cooking at home. The only issue that needs to be addressed are the property and land prices. It is almost impossible to buy a 4 room newly MOP HDB apartment without having a monthly income of at least $6k and that is being conservative.
"Easiest way out, work on your earning capability. Too much focus is on COL and not understanding that we won't return to the past ways of working format. Prices will forever increase as part of general economics101. Those that are not complaining here on reddit are generally out there finding ways to improve their earning power from various sources.

Which is also where the incumbent gov is focusing well on (better jobs and new economy etc) while opposition is mostly focused on COL. Both sides of the coin needs to be tackled."
"I do protein shake in the morning, fast all day until I get home from work, buy soy chicken or western home and do protein shake no.2 pre workout, protein shake no3 post workout at night.. make one meal very nice and expensive and only have one meal and you get to save"
"You'll be surprised at the proportion of people eating there who have no issues paying that much money, especially since there are so many singles staying with their parents and DINKs nowadays"
Where do all these rising cost of living posts from dormant and new accounts suddenly come from
"I have been doing nutrients centred meal planning and bulk cook during weekends, as a budgeting strategy, since I started work. You get a lot more energy, even if you get a $5 salad from the supermarket or some dried fruits/nuts. I don’t drink things with sugar or caffeine, they’re addictive so you need more to get the same fake high, over an extended period. I think no one likes higher cost of living and it needs to be addressed for sure. This should be a front and center promise from every candidate. We also have zero medical bills, my entire family of 4 for 20 years. We work out regularly as well. So we save there as well. My entire family don’t drink alcohol, it’s addictive and expensive, esp at bars, clubs and restaurants. "
"No cause nobody willing to sacrifice or ""do their part"".
- rising cost of labour? Anyone willing to sacrifice their salaries? Give up on performance bonus (obtained your company by scalping customers with high prices)? Demand companies pay their staff ""asian"" labour cost closer to China and neighbouring countries? Instead of paying foreigners low pay, just pay all Singaporeans low pay, and soon we will have Malaysia low cost of living.

-Landcost? Should we insist Gov put a cap on property cost? NO SELLING MORE THAN 25%  OF ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE (within 25 years of purchase)...be it commercial or residential properties 

-education. Should we limit education to the really smarts ones only? And no part time degrees. Cause with higher education, the labour cost will increase as graduates will demand a certain salaries."
Bruh food cost to salary ratio i am quite sure we are literally the lowest in the world. Legit name me one country or city with cheaper food but similar salaries to us. You can complain about housing or car prices but not food.
"Why are you complaining about $10 meals when so many people are driving Tesla's in CBD? You get what you vote for. What annoys me is people are literally ""**fighting**"" for jobs these days. There's so much work to be done on Earth, so why should we be **fighting to do work**?

The other question is, if Singaporeans are truly tired of the rising cost of living then why does PAP still get 70% of the votes? Are they really sorting out the crisis by raising taxes on the wealthy for example?

Oh and subway isn't $6, it's $11 for a complete meal at CBD today."
"Tbh. If you have gone overseas, our food prices are actually quite low if you compare to countries like Australia, Europe etc. A plate of SINGAPORE Noodles in Aus can easily cost AUD$20. 

Transportation is also quite VFM in terms of fare, infrastructure, standards as compared to eg London tube or the aus metros. 

Of cos as a Singaporean we do feel the effects of the rising COL. The CDC vouchers are definitely not helping and are just papers covering crux of the problem. Thus you know what to do on 3 may 2025."
"As countries progress, residents will face rising costs no matter what. Maintenance etc ain’t cheap. Europe itself, a plate of char kway teow is already SGD $20-25. Salads/sandwiches from grocery stores (ntuc equivalent) were about SGD $8-$12 for me when i was working in Europe."
Rising cost of living is a worldwide phenomenon that is not unique just to Singapore. Nobody is spared and nobody enjoys this.
"I just came back from Taiwan, I feel like their food is decently priced with big portions... and seem to taste fresh and arrive hot even when using free delivery services. Kinda feel sad we pay so much for sad food (assembly line food, preserved food, small portions, even out famous chicken rice also cannot find a nice slice of cucumber) cucumber is so cheap why cannot give bigger slice???"
"what fried noodles $10...? the large portion of hokkien mee? anyways i don't think it's that bad in SG as compared to other countries. come to australia... laksa $20, chicken rice $18, fish and chips $15, cheapest mcdonalds meal $12. and salary here is the same in SG after deducting all the taxes. 

but back when i was interning here, i packed the previous day's leftovers for lunch + 1 pack of microwave rice 😂😅

also don't buy soft drinks from convenience store or drink stalls. buy from value dollar/sheng shiong/ntuc and bring it out with you instead. or even better, if pantry have, just take oni... hahah...same for snacks"
"personally,food prices in sgp is cheap when compared to other western nations. panda express ( mixed rice in the US) is usd for 1 entree (roce or noodles) and 2 main (meat ir vege) compared to sgp 2 vege 1 meat at usd 3.xx ish. this wasn't due much to rental but labor costs.

here in sgp,the biggest landlord is the govt and there is no incentive to cut that down. so what other areas they can cut but labor???

i can only attribute that to pap govt and those that voted for them. ask yourself who did you vote for last election and take a countability of the consequences."
"Bring your own food, or at least pack some snacks/sandwiches. 

When I was in uni, food prices in NUS were quite cheap so I was barely breaking even meal prepping. Like, can easily get food for $2.80 to $3.50, over 5 days vs me buying groceries, I saved maybe $2 a week?

Now at work, I work around Tiong Bahru area, paid $6 for thai fried rice and it was kinda average. The cheapest meal I can find is like $5 still, need to walk out to buy cai fan for $3 for 1 meat/1veg. Seara frozen chicken thigh goes for less than $10 for 2kg, and can last a long time. So now my meal prep saves me like, $15 a week? Not a big deal, but I find it better than having to spend a good 15 minutes going out of office, wait to dabao and walk back. Reaching a point where DDK meals are worth the extra $1 or $2 top up over a plate of bland food."
"The inflationary pressures have already subsided long ago. Why then prices keep increasing for food items ?

The simple answer is greed. The merchants, sellers have seen a window of oppurtunity to increase prices when inflation took place. Now they expanded the opportunity window wider to pump up prices higher and higher.. flogging the same excuse of high rentals , wages and raw matetial costs. Greed has no end."
"Already said that the issue is high rental. If rental wasn’t so high, maybe they can afford to hire Singaporeans or Singaporeans can continue to operate their stalls? Lots of older generation hawkers are being forced out to due to rental increase."
"Landlords are the biggest problem. It starts from them increasing rental with every possible excuse. Our govt not doing anything to rein in rentals and just acting blur.

Most of the rising costs are tied to increasing rents."
"I might be repetitive but my only peeve is the rental market which has gone bonkers, I was recently looking to move and the rates are just 🤯"
"Last time i am renting a Condo Common Room during covid time =780 sgd plus PUB.

Then after covid need to transfer as lease ended. 

HDB Common Room = 1000 sgd plus PUB"
Definitely. Cost of living is going up but salaries aren’t.
"All things considered i.e. Inflationary environment across the world SG is managed pretty well. Be it the 'bank for asia' or good monetary policy, or excellent work by our gov workers / agencies on food security and thanks to cheap labour. 

Rising cost - Personally Healthcare is the biggest issue and for majority it could be housing; Unfortunately these are no choices. 

As you noted in your edit - cooking can save tons of money and good from health perspective too. Luckily is is actually a very good stress buster for me."
"Once you start cooking your own meals, food prices are not much of a concern. You get more nutrition for lesser the price (cheap hawker food are honestly extremely unhealthy for you). 

However if you don’t cook, then the price increase does add up. It is a worrying trend and mostly attributed to rental and salary increases. You got to pick your poison, if you want to save the hassle, you got to pay up."
I paid around $6 for noodles near Paya Lebar's hawker centre. Your area are expensive. LOL
well... you can afford to spend $18 on pasta though..
Yup. Totally sick and tired of the expensive high costs of living. I used to pay $5-$6 for the same chicken or pork chop in the past or for a decent meal with a drink. No at least $10 per meal….
"I think comparing food prices in australia isn’t rly fair because although an average meal costs $15-20, their minimum wage is also $21/h last I was there in 2023. 

Malaysia I think is a better comparison for wage/food cost ratio. Their average pay there is under 3k ringgit/mth (and I’m talking jobs like engineers) but their average “hawker”food is like $8-$12. The food prices are high but the wages are low. 

High food prices in australia are justified because the wage is also high. 

With all that being said, i think you yourself can make the comparison between wage and food cost in singapore. It’s really not that high compared to somewhere like malaysia.

Rent and housing is definitely not cheap in Singapore though. I’ll give you that. But at least our gov gives some “discounts” for BTOs"
"I live in NYC now and lunch is around 15-20 usd (19.68-26.24 sgd)

There are a ton of chicken rice places popping up in nyc and they all charge 17.50 usd (23 sgd) CRAZY!

Hopefully prices in Singapore ever reach these levels."
"there is abundant other food with lower prices around. why on earth you're focusing mainly on a mere $10 fried noodles? 

i paid $4 for malay nasi padang, overflowed with so many ingredients. tips? be nice, be friendly, be supportive to the stores you want them to continue. Uncle gave me lots of stuff whilst aunty greeted me, asked me about my work. 

not going to add what other redditors have commented e.g inflationary global, food prices rising not just in Singapore, etc."
"I think it’s always easier to compare to other countries just by comparing its price tag. But do you know you pay higher taxes in Australia as compare to sg? 

Comparing to Malaysia. Food is also cheaper there but if you were to be working full time there, The food is considered expensive. Salary about the same in sg but 3.2x weaker than sg. Then the price is easily 15-20 MYR."
"I think that it’s concerning because don’t talk about hawker, cooking at home also so expensive."
"Yes, very tired lah. As long as PAP is in power, we are dead meat. All prices will go in one direction - up!"
"maybe the posts on Reddit are causing the prices to go up..

So many threads on rising costs, it looks like we are asking for it to be there"
"Honestly, this isn't top of mind for them. A lot of people i know are unemployed and have struggled to land a job. They have housing, car and family commitments, and the PAP government ain't doing much to stop employers from hiring foreigners vs locals who possess the same skill sets and experiences. This is awful. 

Speaking from own personal experience where my own boss hired a British to take over my role at a higher salary level. Why? They also hired a lot of non locals in to work on the APAC business. Why?

Of course, food prices are spiraling out of control. Plus housing (~10% increase for resale flat in a year?). 

We all know who is responsible for the higher prices."
"I'm tired. Food cost has gone up significantly. And not to mention, no jobs. Double whammy. If we don't vote opposition and kick out the FTs we are dead."
"The residential and commercial rent squeeze esp in the past 2 years is pretty nuts... My prev rent renewal (just a lil after the late covid squeeze) faced almost a 100% increase in rent , lucky I had the option to dodge it and the savings so far is almost 80k+ diff at the hh level (Edit: reduced only cuz one sibling had to rent outside to make it more comfy, would be \~100k otherwise)"
Why would they want to focus? They are the biggest landlord. This is the main problem with the current PAP. They have turn Singapore into Singapore INC and they are the boss.
"Food price as in ""prepared food"" altho $10 is getting to US prices. The cost of ingredients has gone up a lot as well, e.g. cooking oil, eggs... between rental and ingredients, the only thing hawkers can squeeze is labor..."
"My costs for food have increased dramatically, almost 40% more now."
I know Australia’s food prices are crazy. Aint no way they are better than us
Do you think the situation for cost of living including property prices and rentals will worsen if the incumbent maintain or improve the number of seats in the parliament? Or is there hope that they will look into these issues?
"You don't get much change from $20 in Australia after buying a cheap meal. 

Singapore has unfortunately just experienced crazy increases from a base price that for a developed country was quite cheap in 2019."
"Agreed. Think the only way we can really control these costs is to produce more of our own food. And even then, it's still going to increase, albeit less, because of rent, labour and utilities."
Malaysia is seriously so expensive for the locals I don’t know how they survive. Pocky was like 6 or 7 ringgit I was stunned. Pepero was 9 ringgit!!!
This! It’s way easier diverting that effort into to making a few hundred dollars more than to spend it figuring out how to save a few dollars here and there each time dining.
constant public sector construction cost increases from T5/Tuas port / NS square etc also drive up housing costs and in turn coffeeshop rentals ..
"I agree with you that it’s a global issue. Thus do you mean that there is nothing that can be done by leaders? And the only way around high cost of living is to amend one’s lifestyle? Buying things on sale, I’ve adopted that for a long time. Guess meal prep might be the way forward"
"Would it be possible to have a cap on rentals? Like retail spaces, coffee shop stall rentals etc to help with mitigating the rising cost? I mean… I would assume that most who can afford to own additional property aside from their HDB, probably is decently well off. Of course there would be other issues such as the operator themselves still charging high prices to have more profits. I just thought of the model that was used in school canteens where rental was low and given priority to less affluent and vulnerable families to have an opportunity to make some income."
"peep earning above 50% percentile should be having it better, can spend, can invest, though overspending (for many) still leads to financial issue.

It also depend on your current life stage and earning power."
"Give me Aussie/NZ levels of labour laws and WLB and I'll gladly cook/meal prep everytime at home. Many Aussies as I know, do not depend as much on ""street""/eatery level food. If wanna compare with other countries, do it holistically. 


Every country's circumstance is different, hence it does not invalid the challenges of one's citizens even if another country has similar state on a specific metric."
I mean…. It would be nice if it’s close to places many of us work at. If not the travel there incurring transport cost and time might not be that suitable. However I get where you are coming from! Thank god for affordable food at hawker Centre and coffee shops!
"Where do you eat that it cost $30 per meal? Yea, health can suffer after if going for cheap and food with preservatives"
"Who are the ‘they’ you are referring to? You mean many ppl are holding good jobs and being able to afford these high cost of living thus not feeling a pinch? 
Sometimes I feel like I’m just close to the bottom of the society"
"Taiwan is able to price their food cheaply mainly because they grow their own food. Singapore don’t farm our own food as much, and most foods are imported, hence the higher price here."
"Well, if you are paid 1200 sgd as a fresh graduate (average Taiwan salary) instead of what we have, can also. It's always relative to purchasing power of locals ma."
"Prices of food is just one of my concern, besides the other rising cost. You’re pretty accurate that foood prices in Aussie is far worse and hence many ppl prefer to buy groceries and cook instead. That being said, there is minimum wage over there, and yes higher taxes too etc. I wonder if overall, are we of the same situation as Aussie in net?"
"Well… seeing some comments in response to my post, it makes me feel like I’m thinking wrongly and that my earnings are something I should relook into as cost of food is higher in other countries. I don’t know man."
"Oh you don’t say, the rental market has gone haywire. I suffered a 50% increase in rental for a HDB room, but decided to continue with it because I really appreciate the neighborhood in terms of amenities like coffee shop, clinics, a small fair price round the corner"
Somehow I feel like my salary increment is below inflation. It’s not even 4% each year. Sometimes it’s 2%-3%. That’s also one issue I’m facing. If not I probably won’t be asking for some good tips relating to cost savings for food.
"For now, rising healthcare cost hasn’t affected me yet, thus I’m not sure how bad is the degree of it now. Could you please share with me on this? 
I often hear ppl stating that our healthcare cost is very affordable compared to many other develop nations (ignore US since things have gone haywire over there)."
I make sure to have at least one meal a day home cook to balance out the cost. Might look into meal prep on weekends for the entire week instead now
"hahahah that quote. Well, it’s not an everyday affair for expensive food for most residents here! Unless I’m wrong"
"Glad to have someone sharing the same thoughts regarding the food prices. I mean yea sure, perhaps it’s not the most crucial issue among all, like property prices, rental prices are rank higher. I don’t know if there is a way to even deflate all these including food prices."
Relatively cheap is sooo subjective. And then there’s the comparison across countries and what not. Can’t we just compare it to our salary increment? Inflation vs salary increment?
How’s your monthly salary like?
"It’s from a chain eatery. The food places around my office are mainly stand alone, with 1 food court where the western food grilled chicken chop cost $10, fish soup cost $8 etc. I mean there’s still the Kaya toast kopi set at $3.90 (no soft boil eggs etc, just toast and drink), but not filling for lunch."
$2k I probably would struggle even more with renting and other basic necessities. So what’s my problem? What do you think?
… if the opposition gets to be in power I highly doubt that prices will go the other direction. That would mean serious issues if it does go in the other direction in fact.
"Is there really absolutely no chance that the situation will improve even if the incumbent continues with its current seats in parliament? They have seemingly done well for other parts of the country such as city development, economy etc"
100% increase in rent is insane! I had mine up by 50% and I’m struggling. Whatever amt I have left to save has been greatly reduced along with the high living cost. Glad you found a better place to reside! Was it through property agent or you look it up yourself on websites like property guru?
What's the reason between commercial rental increase? is there a huge demand? commercial rent was already sky high in SG pre-Covid.
Not near US prices. If you've lived in the US you'll know. Its next level there. Then there's Europe
Look at Grace Fu’s response to COL issue. And the fact that they gave a damn grant to KPT owners for maintaining their toilet. I don’t think they will ever look into controlling these big kpt companies. Rental has been increasing significantly for these kpt stall tenants also - heard from my nearby local fishball shop 😢 They used to sell for $4 last month and recently had to resort to selling for $5 min. bc rental increased way too much. Funny thing is they are the only shop bringing traffic to the damn KPT. All the other chain tenants traffic like shit.
"It’s the crazy increases that ppl have the illusion that food prices are exorbitant and they tend to compare with our immediate neighbours like Malaysia, Thailand etc. Just like another redditor comment, these are emerging markets.. obviously it’s relatively cheaper using our currency. These people should try working in their economy and affording their food, I’m sure it’ll pinch the same, if not more. 
I think food prices have already been kept affordable especially when I can find caifan within $5 for 2 veg 1 meat. People who complain their caifan expensive confirm buying either the seafood or from food courts."
"It’s a relatively common strategy for developed and high COL cities where people would bring their own lunches to work to save on cost. A high COL city simply needs to pay more for labour and rent which is a significant chunk of cost to make prepared food. 

SG food prices has already been kept significantly lower by squeezing labour prices but realistically, their wages need to go up together with everyone else otherwise equity in sg falls. 

In the long run, I’d personally expect eating out to cost prices similar to other high COL cities."
You got it backwards. If we produce our own food it would be crazy expensive
"i tend to agree, but rising labour costs is not itself a bad thing. more expensive labour also means higher tax takings, more household income, more domestic consumption (up to a point). 

we have already begun to toy with the idea of vertical, integrated farms that are highly automated. this can be a good thing, though it’s hard to seek investment for this when we can buy cheaply from our neighbours. we might still do some of this anyway for national security reasons (hot war, trade war or other regional instability)."
"No wonder a sizeable amount of people travel across the causeway and work in SG.  But also on the flip side, that maybe contribute to the high prices"
"lol tell me about it, I buy pepero back to JB for my family.

Fairprice and Sheng Shiong always have the 3 for $4.05 deal"
Ordered juice from road side stall. It was more expensive than my main ckt. 23rm total. Juice was 12. KL is no joke.
"Try Jakarta and Manila. Believe it or not, even more expensive"
It means the reason for increasing prices are global not local la.
"So if entire world kana covid, Singapore alone need to siam and have 0 cases?

The point is that inflation is a global issue, Singapore cannot run from it, especially since we import almost everything."
Singapore doesn’t exist in a vacuum especially being reliant on a global supply chain. If we had our own agricultural industry then it would be different
"If you search “MAS books largest loss”, you might realise that the inflation would be much much worst if we did not had the reserve or financial bullet to keep SGD strong. 

Keeping SGD strong is not without its drawbacks though"
"Government can do one-time offset and vouchers to help but rising costs cannot be countered directly. What they can do is try to ensure wages rise in tandem with rising costs, but this is not a perfect solution either. Also, government cannot mandate what businesses pay their staff.

The reality is, no matter where you go, this will be a constant issue."
"Why does the PAP allow subletting of hawker stores - which benefits no one? All hawker stores should be managed centrally to ensure that no one profits from this. 

Why does PAP  allow companies to buy up coffee shops and raise rental? 40+ million for a coffee shop. How to sell things cheap and still make a profit. Who benefits from these sales?

"Singapore salaries are higher for mid-level roles and above. Tax in Australia and NZ is high. Eating out is a small luxury. I'll laugh when Singaporeans come here and complain about food prices seemingly from the ""cheapest"" hole in the wall Chinese takeaways hahaha.

I truly miss eating out in Malaysia/Singapore for cheap. It is just me appreciating the ambience and atmosphere even if I do so alone. In NZ now and I cannot eat out as often.

Sure, there are many things to complain about Singapore but hawker food prices isn't one. In fact is it possibly the cheapest country on earth to eat out after taking into account salaries."
Their house cost around 100k sgd only
"i can tell you, australia is experiencing the cost of living crisis way worse than sg is. i'm currently living in sydney btw...

locals complain about unaffordable housing. an apartment in the western suburbs (in an undesirable neighbourhood) will cost over 600k. there are minimal to no subsides given out by their govt to homebuyers. rent here is out of control as well. 

groceries in australia aren't cheap too. its way cheaper in sg. i buy all the discounted stuff and home brands, and my weekly grocery bill for myself is $80+. 

if you need any sort of professional help (plumber, electrician etc) it'll cost you a bomb as well.

yeah sure theres minimum wage here, but then again, people on minimum wage here aren't thriving lol. just surviving. just like our own low income population. 

but one good thing here is that they have medicare, meaning going to public hospitals is totally free. medicines free as well."
"The best tip I can offer for saving food cost is meal prepping, cooking for like few days in advance then bringing to work and microwaving like Uni days, alternative in the sandwich prep , I find it saves me a lot rather than spending $10 bucks, hope this helps somewhat"
"No haha, even better. It was just my grandparent's place (where I spent alot of time growing up).. my grandma had declining mobility, so she went to stay with 2 other maternal families under 1 roof just months earlier. There was a temp tenant, but we didn't renew and we took over. Now we 'rent' it from her, money stays in the 'circle'. It's small, but on fringe of CBD, can't complain, tahan only. My aunt was the agent. 

What's not great is that, we were supposed to find a more permanent place, but it's been hard with how the prices have risen so much. We've stayed for longer than we've planned.. grateful for a shelter though."
Possibly due to the ABSD and other restrictions on residential properties. Investor/leeches started moving into commercial/industrial real estate and drove the price up. I own a ramp-up industrial unit - before 2021 the valuation was around $650k. Around 2023 the valuation jumped to $750k and somebody offered to buy the unit for $950k.
"In part due to the elevated interest rates.

Take REITs for examples, they need to service the loan they have and the higher interest rates post covid led to higher debt servicing cost. This in turn led to REITs increasing rental rates to ensure that the dividend payout to shareholders is stable."
"I am no expert, but for some places (malls?) along the TEL line when it opened?, that's the reason. Others IDK. Residential it was just the BTO delays and some (my renewal was around early Q2 '23). At Landlord's whim, basically."
"You see the issue right? If you hire Singaporean to work for $5000 a month, then your food price will also go up 2-3x and the complaining will continue ad infinitum. Look up the upward wage spiral. Please tell us your solution for this issue."
"Sit-down restaurants have raised their prices significantly here in the US. But if you go to food markets, carry outs or hot food section at the supermarket, you can get a  lot for your $10. E.g.  7-11 has 10 wings for 7.99 promos etc"
"The 3-4 coffee shops I patronised got bought over by huge kpt companies, and the zichar stall owners told us that rent tripled and they can’t afford the new rent. Singapore owned  zichar forced to close down. Now it’s an ever revolving door of franchise stores ran by PRCs and selling overpriced and low quality food."
I recall our government also argued that ‘rent does not affect prices’ when they were looking into how the tender system works for hawkers.
"Yes, you’re right, there will always be a diff set of problems, but your point of the comparison is for me to be thankful for my current situation such as having food regardless?"
Just making fun of people who like to blame PAP for the increase in cost of living when it increased worldwide and we are sheltered from the worst of it.
"Trudat, although we can control the costs better if it's in our own hands. With reducing global food supply, SG will need a back up plan. Quite unfortunate that many of the local agrotech had to shut down."
"hmm, why tho? Just curious, is it cause of the cost needed to produce our food? 🤔"
those were positive examples ... what about cross island line/TE line / Jurong regional line / Founders memorial  etc  ... is really everything built absolutely needed and will 100% give us returns ? then there is no end of it and price increases is fact of life ... the truth is such massive infra spending might only have marginal increases in efficiency
Cant really recall if i went to Westfield Carousell or some other location. But the price i paid was like AUD10.90 for that bowl of noodles. But you are right. The norm is AUD18 and above. i just recalled eating another bowl of noodles for about AUD20. Maybe the place i went for that AUD 10.90 noodles is an ulu one.
exactly. Don’t understand these folks complaining about food prices in Singapore.
"the solution is short term pain for long term gain, rather than temporary fixes that merely kick the can down the road. 

let’s define the solution as “income that rise more naturally in response to growing costs of living”. this means things like entrepreneurship, productivity and holistic sustainability (long term) are good focuses, while rent-seeking, monopolies and unsustainable (short term) growth are bad focuses. 

price rises are due to demand increases beyond supply availability. the “singapore way” is to let market forces work and allow higher prices to reduce demand. this can work well with things like luxuries (cars vs COE and ERP pricing), but some demands cannot be priced away (e.g. food or shelter). 

to reduce overheads, the main target appears to be labour, which we resolve by bringing in cheaper migrant labour. but migrants still “compete” for the supply of food and shelter (which, as we posit, cannot be priced away). 

clearly, these fall into the “bad” focuses - short term and rent-seeking. 

to reverse this, we need better incentives for broad-based entrepreneurship to solve local problems (e.g. we don’t need more middlemen or “commissioned agents”, we need providers of real products and services that address local needs), to do so with more efficiency (e.g. automation, vs short term cheap labour) and to pay for these through higher taxes (e.g. a capital gains tax may disincentivise property speculation and/or a punitive estate tax, which punishes multigenerational hoarding of wealth and assets but incentivises early distribution of accumulated wealth).

we could also end “for profit” public housing and refocus on affordability that meets changing needs. allowing a glut of housing will bring housing prices down and disincentivise landlords. 

similarly, rent control on commercial property will do the same, making it less risky to be entrepreneurial. you are more likely to start a business if rents are affordable, and more likely to succeed if your landlord doesn’t double your rent just because you do well in one financial year. making rents fixed over longer periods (say five years) with increases that can be contested (e.g proper rent consultants who work for the renter, and not only for the landlord) will help small businesses become more sustainable (rather than incentivising large international chains who control prices through scale - haven’t you noticed how every mall in SG seems to have the same tenants?)

when these small businesses focus on solving local problems (e.g. higher value goods and services that are needed by the community), we create a virtuous cycle of useful wealth creation. 

this will be painful to developers with large land banks, and to ordinary singaporeans who have already overinvested in the HDB leasehold “scam”. however, this pain will be temporary (~ two generations or so).

low risk, high return rent-seeking is not significantly different from the feudalism and slavery, yet it is what we have been taught to aspire to. this, i feel, must end."
"Already said that the issue is high rental. If rental wasn’t so high, maybe they can afford to hire Singaporeans or Singaporeans can continue to operate their stalls? Lots of older generation hawkers are being forced out to due to rental increase.

Btw, wage spiral suggests that wages are at least rising. Which is much better than stagnant income and rising prices"
I was in California last year. Expenses were crazy high. Even grocery and prepping meals were expensive. Only the odd Asian takeout where they stuff the entire container till it flows over had good value.
"Ah yes, corporations and private entity rental prices are a personal responsibility. Sorry my bad, I didn't realize that I can tell landlords to just lower their rent."
"I think the gov can only control and help so much. They can't control global market prices for commodities, giving vouchers is to offset this cost of living is the next best thing they can do. Can't mandate that business need to increase salries for employees as well so next best thing is encouraging us to keep upskilling but is it effective? Up for debates.

You can only save so much, what you should be focussing on is to increase your earning potential. Btw I am not some PAP die hard nor am I a opposition die hard, just neutral and looking at facts"
"Ah yeah probably a special. It does exist, but it is incredibly rare. In Auckland there's a Malaysian restaurant that does $11-15 specials. Another HK Cafe here has meals for $6-11. A vege Indian stall in Auckland University's food court for $9. One or 2 PRC cai fan shops for $12.

But usually this kind of price point is only good to have a single meal fish and chips or pie in a bakery. Or box of sushi. Or pizza from Domino's/Pizza Hut.

Ang Moh eating habits is usually light and simple for breakfast/lunch- pie, sandwich, etc. Not a full meal like us Asians."
"When PAP owns and controls everything, cost will only go up. In fact, the global economy is not as rosy as PAP painted it. Who increase GST? Who increase rent? Who own kopitiam? Who own CapitaMall? Who own coffeeshops? Who bring in rich foreigners and make them PR and citizens? And many more…"
COL in CA seems higher - which city were you in? Groceries at the Asian supermarkets here are significantly lower than chain stores although it could change with tariffs. Ethnic markets and neighborhoods can be a lot cheaper e.g. hispanic food truck (which is why I need to learn more Spanish) and certain Chinatowns.
Can’t Singaporeans just accept a lower pay so companies can bring their labour costs down? /s
SF-but nearer to Daly City. Yeah 99 ranch is still pretty expensive here. Gotta head to Chinatown but the cost savings are not that much.
"Cos singaporean can't survive on air and meditation to heal their sickness.

Why don't MP take a small cut in salary so tax won't be so high or even no need to increase GST?"
"i can’t say i enjoyed indonesia much. in my experience, uk and australia are pretty similar in their respective dysfunctions. singapore beats all three (and many others besides) on efficiency, hands down, no contest. 

but that’s still saying “others are worse”. 

didn’t your singaporean parents (and also everybody’s lau peh) tell you not to compete with the worst in your class, but the best in your class? and when you’re the top of your class, don’t they tell you to compare with the top in your cohort?

when i talk about an effective civil service, i mean a civil service that does the best job it can do for the singaporean people - regardless of who is in power. 

that last bit is the important bit.

not only should the civil service be competent, it also needs to be impartial. and it must take care to APPEAR impartial. only then can it be trusted.

when the civil service is captured politically (and there are many examples of these today), trust degrades, and then truth disappears, until finally, we’re all scrabbling in the dark. 

do most singaporeans trust our government? do we trust our civil service? not in a passive way, like “no choice mah”, but in an active way. if so, why are there still so many in the so called “vocal minority”?"
"No, I'm saying it's not something that costs so significant to not include in a meal that I already paid for. If you are to charge me for cucumber slices on top of the amount I already paid then... it's  just sad!"
"Do you honestly think the small cut in their salary does anything? To put it in context, govt always announce hundreds of MILLIONS to be distributed as CDC voucher. End up each HOUSEHOLD get 2-300. For the whole YEAR."
"While it's nice to get some voucher, it barely puts a dent in the total annual food and groceries expenditure of a regular 3-4 member household, so it borders on being offensive. It's like when people give a hundred dollar note for a $99.80 bill and they tell the server to keep the change like they're doing the server a huge deal."
The ones most affected by rising costs are exactly the ones who can't go anywhere else.
"I you seem to really underestimate the difficulty of “moving” to another country.

Remote work in Singapore is not “becoming more common” - it has stabilised around 20%, and only 16% of employers support full remote work. Even “full remote work” doesn’t mean the ability to work overseas - many companies don’t allow you to do so because they are afraid of tax and legal implications, other require you to expatriate in the overseas office and get paid in the local currency / salaries.

Even if you are allowed to work abroad, you can’t simply move abroad without a digital nomad or retirement visa, which may have wealth / income requirements and other limitations.

The harsh truth is that living abroad and earning SGD (or not needing to earn money at all) is the privilege of a small minority who isn’t likely the ones more suffering with the cost of living."
"No other first world country is cheaper than SG. SG has cheap hawker food for daily meals, reliable public transport system, is a walkable city with good infra, low income tax. If one decides to migrate, it'd be about work-life balance and change of scenery. SG is small and boring, no nature to enjoy. Cost of living isn't a good motivator to migrate. If you read this subreddit, u would see a lot of ppl who worked, migrated elsewhere always come back here eventually. Taxes are so high in countries with proper infra and healthcare."
australia lower cost ??? seriously ?
"Rising costs of living and inflation are global issues and honestly I think Singapore has it better than many other countries. Remote work isn’t as simple as taking Singapore salary against whatever country’s cost of living. It’s a whole new level of job competition where you no longer have an often overlooked advantage of being a Singaporean citizen.

The dreaded endgame is what you see in many global cities where house ownership is nothing but a pipedream and rental is the default reality."
"As long as you stick to HDB and no car ownership, SG is still affordable relative to many other cotes in the world. Our currency is strong and passport is the best so travelling around Asia and Central Asia still very affordable.

The problem is if you want to cross into the high SES level. That's when it becomes unreachable for most locals."
"for most people, family commitments, kids’ education, and elderly parents make leaving Singapore not so simple. But if you’re single, earning in SGD/USD, and can remote work from Malaysia or elsewhere, confirm can enjoy a much lower cost of living. The grass may seem greener, but until you actually live overseas, you won’t fully understand the trade-offs—safety, efficiency, healthcare, and even small things like convenience. Worth trying if you have the chance, but SG still got its perks despite the high costs!"
"I don’t think people will be forced to leave but I do foresee people who might previously be considered middle income being pushed into being lower income due to the high inflation reducing the amount of disposable income.  How this translates is that people would be forced to cut back on wants such as not being able to on eat out at restaurants, not being able to go on holidays and etc"
"As long as ur income matches up. 

Lower cost country tend to have low income. Not for everyone."
"Unless you can find high paying jobs in places like Cambodia, Thailand etc., everywhere else is as expensive or even more expensive than SG. But then you give up things like safety, reliability etc in those countries. Don’t forget about things like healthcare etc that can be way more expensive and inaccessible than in Singapore (those countries with free healthcare will kill you with their ridiculous taxes, and the healthcare systems are very poor). There is rising cost in the entire world, not just Singapore…"
"Earning sgd and spending sgd is definitely sustainable

10 per meal 3 meal per day on food is 900,

Transport say 150 per month

Utility 100 per month

Phone+Internet 50 per month

900+150+100+50=1200, and i believe these numbers can be lowered by a lot if you really want to save money


As for housing, it's doable to get 2rm resale with single 4k/month income(i got mine at 360k), if married couple getting 4rm under 600k should be doable,


Yes, cost did increase over the years, but definitely not un-liveable like many people thinks

If you are not high earner in Singapore, what make you think you can earn high enough overseas?"
"People have always been leaving Singapore, which was why the ‘quitters’ term came up during GCT’s time.

For what it’s worth, SG still has a very high iPhone index, so the cost of living is probably not that bad for the average person.

It would be more useful to drill down to certain demographics, such as singles who don’t have a degree, and somehow unable to stay with their parents. 

Personally, I believe that if one takes away many discretionary items, such as cars/COE and smoking, Singapore is still affordable. Housing is the elephant in the room, but my probably unpopular opinion is that some people will have to be ok with buying the smaller older flats."
"Actually by law you can't work from another country full-time, you'll need to have some sorts of work visa in that country, and there are problems with tax too. Moreover, why a company offer a Singaporean level pay for a Singaporean to work in a different country instead of hiring a local there to work at local pay grade?"
"Fully remote roles where you can work anywhere are quite rare and competitive since you're vying with the entire world. You either have to accept lower salary (which defeats the purpose) or have a really sought-after skillset (which most people don't have), so that's not an option for most. Otherwise, if you're thinking of picking up a job in a lower COL country, you'll (generally) have to contend with lower pay, higher tax and no citizenship benefits.

Despite this I think we'll still see people move overseas for the less hectic lifestyle/change of pace, but I doubt there'll ever be a large migration."
"If you can find remote work that pays well enough, and is ok with you working at different hours.... Why not try for a few years?

But Singapore is still quite cheap to live a comfortable life compared to many places on the same level."
"I don’t think Singaporeans will leave in droves. But we may see a small reduction in the amount of expats.

Recently my company has been offering expats who
are at the end of their contract here to move to cheaper countries. Previously they just let you extend. They’ve also stopped handing out packages that’s full of goodies (eg lower rent allowance, no kids education etc). 

A recently joined expat was comparing his accom choices with the ones who came a year ago and realised he was only offered condos in the heartlands. 

My HR has been pretty upfront about it. Staying in SG is getting expensive, you can just remote in from TH or MY. Expats also usually live in enclaves anyway lol"
"Before you start moving aboard, remember that Singapore used to be dirt poor. 1960 Singapore's per capita GDP was a lowly 1252 Singapore dollars. 2023 it's about 114K Singapore dollars.  90x increase, nothing to laugh at.  Of course Singapore back then could have chosen to be dirt poor and cheap, thankfully we did not choose that path.  This post would not have been written for certain.  There are countries today that are still developing, you can always move abroad to those countries, just keep in mind that there's a reason why wealthy people choose Singapore and not those other countries.  Rising costs are happening everywhere.  Regardless, the relatively strong Singapore dollar has somewhat buffered against the rising costs compared to many other countries.  If you think you have it bad in Singapore, move somewhere else and you'll realise how good you actually had it."
"Everywhere else is the same.. but as a Singaporean, I don't like it here and yes, I am one of the few that is not happy and wants to leave. 

It's too stressful and rigid. My whole life feels like I need to be forever in the corporate rat race just to pay my bills and top up CPF for my retirement. I just can't find a meaningful meaning for my life in SG. 

Thankfully I don't have a mortgage and can quickly do so."
"Singapore actually has a much lower cost of living relative to income, compared to most developed countries.

Median salaries are high, tax is extremely low, food can be very cheap, housing is cheaper (especially with BTO schemes, low monthly interest rates, government grants, CPF,  and other deductions), and most of the population live at home with their parents until they're married.

The studies constantly show that Singapore is expensive if you want to live a life of luxury, own a car (which you don't need since the public transport is so cheap and efficient), or if you're an expat that needs to send the kids to an international school. 

Most Singaporeans don't leave to work overseas (there is plenty of data which shows this), and that will continue to remain the same. Costs are higher in other developed countries, and salaries are far lower in the countries you referred to. Even the inflation rates seen in Singapore have been lower compared to most other economies."
"I immediately eye rolled on your first line saying Singapore is expensive to live in.

you need to get out more."
"Inflation is everywhere. Rich people are pissed off at the higher property taxes (yes #richpeopleproblems) and middle class is getting squeezed by the higher property prices and $100k COE, not to mention all the tuition classes that kids need to take nowadays to just keep abreast of their peers. 

And then there is the Singapore Government self-inflicted shotgun blast to their ass of two 1% GST increases during a period of high inflation.

Went to Marche last night at 313 Somerset and a rosti with sausage was $23.90. WTF??? When did it get THAT expensive? 

So yes you will see people leaving but I don't think it will be a massive wave since Singapore still does offer a few great things like political & financial stability, strong civil government (but someone please explain why we need mayors?), good infrastructure (erm maybe not with all those MRT breakdowns), solid SGD, and high level of safety and security. So all that will count for a lot in people's considerations about whether to move or not."
"I think the younger generations will be able to cope with inflation since they have income.  The challenge remains whether they have to lower their standard of living to keep up - live in a smaller apartment and give up owning a car.

The more serious challenge lies with the older generations, with lower income or already retired.  Their income and savings won't be enough to cope if costs continue to rise.

It means many more people will have no choice but to continue working even as they grow older. FIRE might be out of reach for many people."
"Cost of living in malaysia is going up as well, its just that you’re not earning their salary."
Economics 101...the cost will go down if people start leaving
where can we go? western world like Australia is also facing steep increase in cost of living too
"Housing? Definitely expensive. This one is hard to argue otherwise.

Food and transportation? It’s actually pretty cheap overall imo. And Singaporeans still complain about Nasi Padang/Indian/Vegetarian being rip-offs when they don’t enjoy the same economies of scale as other ubiquitous dishes like chicken rice and cai png."
"Have you tried finding out how difficult it is to stay long term in another country? Unless you're going with a job offer, or have lots of money to invest, start a business, or just to pay big sum for a multiple entry visa, few countries will not want you there for free. As a tourist, we can go to many places for 30-90 days or thereabouts, and you're unlikely able to rent accommodation long term legally.

And if you're a low income earner in Sg, you think your salary will go any higher in places like msia or Thai?"
"Honestly, inflation is a global thing, it’s not unique to Singapore. Housing prices esp for btos and hdbs are still comparatively cheaper than other tier 1 cities in Asia"
"1. SG always tops the cost of living rankings but this is usually from expat perspective

2. Can't talk about cost alone. It's also the wages and whether what you get is value for money

3. Moving overseas is not that simple. Some visas can be hard to get or you basically need to be rich (then why you need to leave SG in the first place). Furthermore you also end up being the foreigner now

That doesn't mean we can't improve or that we should be fine with the cost of living. But the grass is always greener on the other side"
"i'd move away in a heartbeat.  


everything in sgp is on a lease ever since pap gov decided public housing should be subjected to market speculation the likes of private properties.

  
if you think cpf is your money, remember,you are lending money to the gov and will not get it back unless you meet their ever increasing benchmark for retirement.

get fucked sgreans."
"I'll stay. Cos moving to countries like Thailand or Malaysia, they may be cheaper but there are costs that I don't need to pay for: 
- Housing. My mortgage is already paid here. No point for me to pay rent elsewhere. 
- Car & driving related costs. Gave up driving for walking and public transport. 
- Safety. There's a reason why the aunties and uncles here wear their Rolexes on an everyday basis without worries."
"It’s all about perspective. Sure SG can be expensive. But also can be considered cheap for others.

Social media most of the times are just showing the nice side of things. But there could be and will be the darker side of things which can be overall worst.

Regardless of the country you going to be living, you have to consider all the other variables. Sure might he cheap for groceries but expensive for taxes, housing and you need a car for travel since public transport is non existent.

Just don’t compare 1 or 2 things."
"I think depends on your education (which by and large affects your pay) as well as your preferred lifestyle 
+ if in a relationship, Earning power of your spouse, Decision to have kids or not and how many kids etc.

I don’t think it is that bad (?) like it’s definitely gone up but is it that suffocating? 
Because the whole world is facing this inflationary pressure issue, so most places you go, would be feeling it too.

If you’re throwing in MY and TH etc, then historically they’re cheaper and would still be cheaper (tho in their context , COL has risen too)"
"1. cost of living is well managed by the govt through CDC vouchers which solves this issue completely

2. transport if super affordable despite the annual fare hikes and increased incidence of train breakdowns - another non-issue

3. salaries are rising rapidly and keeping up with inflation, even with the uptrend in property prices over the past years

4. food is affordable and has definitely not hiked 50% or so over the past couple of years

5. housing is becoming more and more affordable as wages are rising to keep up with the higher price tags

6. singaporeans are definitely being employed and picked over foreign workers despite the higher salaries they receive 

/s for those who can’t tell….."
"Everywhere is going to shit now lol where you want to run to?

Where is the promised land of no inflation and good standard of living easy life?

You run to Australia New Zeland Canada people also complaining about CoL and look at you funny for coming here."
Leave to where? I don't think there's many places with sustainable wage growth and a reasonable cost of living. Unless you're doing something like receiving SG pay but living elsewhere
"THIS

The sgeans going to US, UK, AUS usually either have parents paying for their Uni degrees, or good jobs which allow them to transition to a new country without substantial sacrifices."
People think about cost of living but never think about income to COL ratio
"If you don't have to pay rent, Singapore is pretty affordable."
"disagree.  Singapore is significantly more expensive than Hong Kong now.  It used to be the other way around, and it's not because HK has gotten cheaper, it's because SG is just now significantly more expensive.  Things got expensive from COVID inflation, and then inflation went up even more over the past 2 years, which I don't understand why prices would continue to go up so much post-COVID."
"Australia is facing a cost of living and rental crisis … 

A number of people whom I know moved to Aussie years back returned to sg recently…"
"I’m from Australia (so admittedly my COL is higher in Singapore than a local) but we’ve calculated, it would definitely be cheaper for us to move back to Australia (even after factoring in the lower tax rate here).

It’s not a huge difference, but Singapore is definitely more expensive."
If you include housing and car than yea. Lower cost.
"Most people aren't content with just 'survivable' anymore.

What is life if you're just mindlessly going about your daily life like a drone. At that point even your weekends become part of a schedule.

People want to *live*. We live in an age where humans produce more than enough food for the entire world but yet there are still people dying of starvation. Capitalism has been gamed out and newcomers (newborns) are too late into the game to cross the barrier of entry to be 'successful' without being funded (supported by rich parents etc.)

In poe terms: we need a new league."
"Actually really agree with your last sentence. When I went house hunting, there were really nice and big older flats (like 20- 30 years old) that were priced very comfortably. Just that they aren’t in prime locations but usually with bus stops right out front and only 3-4 stops from train station. Nowadays a lot of people are chasing condos and prime locations, of course small and expensive lah."
Hold up. You no mortgage and need to be in the rat race just to pay your bills? Where is your money going??
"I have a mortgage but left SG anyway.... and I can't afford to live in my own flat! With the pay I'm getting here in the US, I'd be spending more than 30% of my income on rental, unless I have a bunch of roommates. Am not from a rich family either, paid for everything myself and was just an average wage worker in SG... not particularly talented either!"
"1) Wow I didn’t know CDC few couple hundreds can solve inflation completely. Grocery 100$ per month?

2) transport packed like sardine fish - is inconvenient family with toddler as COE how much 100k?

3) salary increase rapidly? Which data you are referring to? HDB price outpaced salary increment

4) 50% in few years then we got bigger issue. More like 30% however, I agree still consider affordable but no longer consider cheap (if data shown X people’s collecting gst vouchers. 

5) likewise above, which data you are referring? Hdb/private outpaced salary increment

6) not totally true though.

I know election is coming"
That's right. SG is a city state so the rent is equivalent to other big cities in similar countries like Aussie even though SG could cost slightly more.
"Living in the USA: Fuck needing a car

The difference is that in SG, you don’t NEED a car. Meaning you don’t need to pay extra costs or deal with the headaches of battery failure.

In the USA, if you have no car, you are dead. You can’t go anywhere.

Anyone who believes cheap cars are better than a good public transport system has never lived anywhere without one."
"Aussie dollar actually very weak now. Go there holiday same price as going BKK.

That being said rent and medical costs will probably still kill you."
"Yea...I think some people need to take a good hard look at whether grass on the other side is really greener. Discounting those who moved overseas on the back of mama/papa scholarship, it really isn't cheap to live there by any means and probably even more ex. Yea you get to live in a house, but be prepared to share with at least 2-3 housemates to be able to afford it. Yall think housing here is ex, wait till you see the homeless folks there.

Ofc this is just from a pure costs perspective la, like there's plenty of very valid reasons to move there too like WLB, more nature etc"
disagree. u have to look at things from a global scale to actually understand singapore's position. u cant expect us to have 2% inflation when the us and uk and others were contending with inflation over 9%
"I'm glad to see more of such posts on here, it's a pleasant surprise from the usual rants/complaints of redditors who wanna lie flat and also KP why they cannot afford the 5 room HDB in the prime location. But it's HDB mah, pUbLic hOuSinG what"
"We are the winners of capitalism. ""Most people"" always implicitly assume only those living in developed countries. Cross the border north or down south, and you realize that most people are actually just surviving and are content if they can do just that.

We talk about food and starvation, and implying we should redistribute wealth. But are you willing to distribute it cross the border? Or do you just want equality among Singaporeans? I guarantee you your QoL will go down if you seek true world wide equality.

It's not just their parents, it's geopolitical boundaries too that gate wealth and ""success"". Wealth begets wealth, and we as a nation are enjoying that."
"Ya sia, these kind of statements always got some kind of exaggeration. Unless you have some recurring medical bill, there's no way your monthly bills here are that bad. With all the rebates given by the govt on utilities and all I haven't had to fork out a single cent for the past 6 mths it feels like. No kids though tbf"
I mean in general... No mortgage doesn't mean no renovation loan... No mortgage doesn't also mean no personal loan for a car..  commitments are everywhere these days..  how many of us are sandwiched also by our own family and parents also...
This! I had to spend $30-40 just for parking everyday in Canada. The Uber and public transport there are much more expensive and unreliable so I get why cars are useful there but can’t find enough reasons for SG.
I hear tax rates are high too. Aren’t medical costs heavily subsidised though?
"Lived in MEL for 2 yrs. Groceries is way cheaper in AU.. Milk, poultry unbeatable. Best part is VARIETY"
"unfortunately it is though, look at housing as an example - singapore’s property prices are not so bad! look at hong kong, new york etc etc! they are much worse! 

so what? do we really want to end up where they are before we start acknowledging that this is a real issue? why are we comparing ourselves to the worst just to paint a picture that we’re doing ok?"
"You non-complaint  attitude and think that SG Gov is doing so much good, is the reason for the singapore's rising cost of living. Look at the population white paper for example, if singaporean didnt go out all the way to complain and stop them, LSL will just turn it to reality and may even exceed 7 million pop by 2030. 7 million squeezing on the island ,how will it affect the daily COL and housing? Think again"
i’m more so talking about ‘social goods’ like public housing and food which saw ridiculous inflation like 40% or something - and these can be addressed actually with policies
But no mortgage puts u way ahead financially compared to many.. like u also said everyone has other cost as well PLUS their mortgage.
"Better work life balance at the cost of salary, high taxes, safety, racism from locals? No thanks."
"From a govt’s perspective, rising housing prices are an issue for who? New buyers/entrants to the market. A large chunk of its population are home-owners and have their retirement plans pretty much tied in with their home prices. 

BTOs have been a workable solution to this problem without impacting the other demographic. Of course limited supply is an issue against a rapidly expanding population but the number of projects have been ramped up in recent years. New flats don’t sprout up overnight and just as many bemoan about not getting a subsidized flat, there also many who got their keys to one and have a sizeable capital appreciation since."
"looking at the figures itself
a BTO 4 room in woodlands of May 2017 costed around 270k
a BTO 4 room in woodlands of Feb 2025 is estimated to cost an average of 445k
thats an inflation rate of around 6.445%. 

for food im kinda lazy to find the cpi numbers but other than a 8% spike in food inflation after covid, inflation for food has been hovering around or under 2%. 

furthermore, i do think the govt is starting to ramp up their BTO building rate and even cutting down on how long it takes, ive seen some launches at/under 3 years of building. 

personally think inflation was crazy back in 2022ish, and housing prices are defo getting expensive, but i dont think policies wise its that bad. i know i know, everyone hates desmond for the monitoring nonsense but in order to see the effect of higher supply we prob have to wait till about 2027/28 to see any changes"
"Yes i don't have a mortgage and i am ahead to most Singaporeans but i still don't like it in SG and have clear intention to leave in the future, 

Being ahead doesn't mean i am not subjected to other cost of living issues. I still don't like the lifestyle the Singapore system offers or the Singapore dream everyone talks about. The thoughts of a life long corporate rat race doesn't appeal to me, it doesn't make me happy."
"1kg fresh chicken breast  I buy from costco/butcher AUD 6.99

">Of course limited supply is an issue against a rapidly expanding population but the number of projects have been ramped up in recent years

The thing is, the *citizen* population hasn't even rapidly increased. Ofc the usual suspects will go after the new citizens but the ~~stars~~ stats show that the new citizen intake has been more or less kept at the same rate. 

So you're spot on, rising housing prices actually benefits Singaporeans the most. Ofc the problem is how you distribute those benefits evenly la but it's still a local benefiting at the end of the day

COVID really messed things up but frankly the current gen beta citizens are probably gonna benefit from the eventual surplus of HDB supply once they grow up if I had to guess"
"bro u talk about policies then u must talk about government initiatives like BTO and grants etc, not look at free market"
Ok so u can just go. Rent our Sg place and stay abroad
yes and the rental can be used to pay the mortgage aboard.
"Cost of living going up is a major thing and I feel that alot of it is pretty much inevitable. Having worked overseas for extended periods, many Singaporeans don’t realize how insane it is for a global city with our average wages to have food options at these prices. Also, taking into account average wages against cost of living, we aren’t faring that badly.

I’m not saying we should adopt a grateful stance devoid of any criticism but with inflation being a worldwide phenomenon, it is what it is. To me, cash is king. We can’t fight agains the direction of the tide but we can always look to lower our expenses whenever we can, without sacrificing too much comfort. 

However I can’t help but feel sad or sorry for upcoming graduates both now and in the future. I don’t think this is a cyclical recession issue with regards to work opportunities but more of saturation over the years of the workforce and lesser opportunities as Singapore starts to lose its appeal as an APAC destination for MNCs. Being at the top pretty much means it can only go downhill from there.

That being said, it’s not the end of the world and I strongly encourage younger Singaporeans to head abroad if a work opportunity presents itself. Your world and career isn’t limited to geographical boundaries and not to sound snarky, but Singaporeans really have it good in this aspect for a long time. In pretty much most developed first world economies, it’s a norm that you have to move cities/states for your studies and also for work if you don’t live in the capital. Only in Singapore do you get to do all of the above in the same place. At the risk of overgeneralizing, I think it has made us stale in a way. And those ‘good times’ are coming to an end in my opinion.

“We’re not meant to save the world. We’re meant to leave it.” Kind of overdramatic but you get the point."
Feelsbad but at least no need worry getting bombed like Gaza or Ukraine. Spend less on wants.
"feel sian and suck thumb. every country got inflation, go everywhere all the same"
"It's going to hit a tipping point where things are going to get very bad for everyone. Everything is linked in cause and effect. Higher price of living = Need for higher salaries = Companies needing to pay more for less workers = Less jobs available = More unemployment/home ownership = Less families started = Lower child birth rate = Next generation has not enough people to participate in the workforce = Companies can't get work done = Economic downturn...

So on and so forth. We're on a train track to failure right now."
" I just don't eat out unless there is a good reason to. like a celebration. I skip breakfast also, so that saves a lot. 

I grew up relatively low middle income so I never saw eating out as a necessity or central to my life. but yes, I still meet up with friends and so we complain bout life while eating overpriced food in chain restaurants."
"Honestly, food and transport is ok. But then hor, ANYTHING outside of this like entertainment? It’s ridiculous.

Easily $100-$200 for a night out, karaoke $60-$70 per person if you order drinks. So a simple dinner + drinks could easily be $200. Movie with popcorn and 2 drinks cost about $50?"
"Got to cut back on unnecessary expenses then start prioritizing your expenses, and start putting savings into investments that gives yearly returns so your savings do not lose their spending power."
I feel like $10 is no longer enough anymore. I could end up spending $20 per day on meals alone.
"Not me but my dink friends told me this.

Monthly food for both couple: $500-$1000 depending on if they dine out more.

Bills / insurance: $500

Hdb mortgage: $0 cash cos fully covered by cpf OA.

Travel: $2000 ( average per month, they travel 3-4 times a year)

Misc: $1000 

Total for both: $4500

Minus the travel: $2500

Very affordable."
Sure other countries might have it worse but the fact is inflation and gst outpaced my wage growth. I can't even have a meal that feels full without spending at least 4.5 now. And i still have to save to buy a house that is also ever increasing?
"Meal prep probably good way to cut some costs while still having a healthy diet. Frozen chicken, broccoli, some whole grains and you be set.


Also cut the drinks and prep yourself also. Drinks are the killer both in cost and sugar levels. "
"eat out less, lose weight at same time since buying lesser unnecessary junk food

"CPI = Cai Png Index  
This will be the marker for future Standard of living conditions.

yes ... our status as 1st world country with affordable hawker prices is a bliss.

"For the long term, there should be some exploring of overseas residency in old age as previously expensive locations like UK, Europe and Japan get even cheaper but this is mainly from currency and wage growth there not keeping track.

In the short term, it's actually not too difficult to minimise costs as switching costs are a lot lower than past years. 

Stuff like online shopping, grab pickup (20% discount with subscription is often cheaper than buying at stall), camping for shopee $2 off $10 every night to buy vouchers require minimal time investment. Sharing intangibles with friends or neighbours help to drive costs down a lot, like Netflix and even enrichment apps for kids like geniebook, koobits etc.

For big ticket items like housing and cars. It is impt to see that the latter is depreciating and have a lifecycle cost of ard $1m while the former tho appreciating in most cases require good selection because there are unfortunate cases where ppl buy high and sell at a loss.

One thing to note is one very high invisible cost that most people dun really factor in is scam investments and investment companies. Had friends who all-in or significantly invested in singapore registered companies for paper gold or keep signing ILPs with negative gains. My take is that if u invest decently and with a lot of proper due diligence u are set up for an above average life."
"I don’t feel secure. 

I think we are at New York levels of expensive without the vibrancy diversity and authenticity. 

I am thankful my parents will be fine in their semi retirement (they don’t need much) and in 20-30 years I plan to find some low cost corner of the world to live out my days and die."
"It’s legit out of control in Singapore. Few years ago back in 2020 I could get chicken cube + plain steamed egg at my HDB coffee shop $2.80, chicken rice was $3. Now the same exact meal, same location is $4.20 and $4.50 respectively. It boggles my mind how the government has not had a better handle on things like this, especially the rental which has caused the stalls to change hands like 4 times over past 5 year(Cai Fan stall)"
Well the median income has gone up about $400/mo in the last 2 years.  That's going to absorb the additional cost of 200 cakes from 4 leaves or 400 hawker meals every month. I don't think this is a crisis.
No choice. Now 1 pack of veg rice share amongst 2 vs last time each one buy 1
M2 money supply has been inflating at an average rate of 7% a year since the end of the gold standard. The rise in prices is the consequence of that money printing. You want out? Adopt the hardest money on earth. Our government could do nothing about it.
"Pulled out the **It is what it is** card years ago. 

Vowed to not have children, especially since I have hereditary conditions that they *really* don't need to experience alongside spending buttloads of money on it.

How do we survive? We just do mate, we just do. Plus ya know, silver linings when we compare ourselves to other countries. Comparison is usually the thief of joy, but in this regard the inflation in our nation is basically ungodly compared to what some other countries are experiencing"
"Cost of living in SG isn’t high. Still plenty of cheap food options, cheap transport, even taxi is hella cheap for a first world country."
"Inflation is real and exists globally. With regard to the cost of living, we (wifey and I) make a conscious effort to eat out less since our largest monthly expenditure (which can be controlled in a way) would most likely be food.

Next would be grocery shopping - where sometimes we will compare prices across brands of a product.

Other than that, we just invest regularly, hoping to beat inflation... 

And not forgetting, trying to earn a higher income... To keep up with the price increase of the day to day items / food.. Who will say no to more $?"
I feel Trump was supposed to help us with it but he is more worried about taking over Canada and Greenland than make good. He is still blaming Biden for egg prices for God sake.

"For long-term survival, focusing on skill upgrading through programs like SkillsFuture could help maintain employability. Stand ready for job losses. 

Building emergency savings, exploring side income opportunities, and practicing prudent financial planning are also practical steps to prepare ahead.

Spend within your means and always have your hospitalization insurance for medical emergencies."
"Personally i feel that the drastic increase in cost of living is caused by greedy landlords raising rents ""just because they can"".

A noodle stall i patronise in a privately owned industrial estate recently have to move because the landlord decided that they are earning a lot and thus wants to raise their rent from S$900 to S$3000 after a 'courtesy' reno of their stall space. of course the stall owner said no and moved elsewhere.

And i feel like this is not an isolated case. Plenty of shop owners are facing the same situation, but not everyone is fortunate enough to be able to move. And when rental increases, the shop owners have 'no choice' but to increase their prices in order to maintain their profit margins (especially the franchisees).

And i also think that this isn't isolated to just Singapore, but a worldwide phenomenon where global wealth is actually being siphoned upwards to the richest."
"It’s just gonna get worse from here. U can opt not to eat out and prep meals, yes groceries increased but not as much as eating out. 

Thing are just gonna hyper inflate esp with trade war etc and job opp will go down with the incumbent policies."
I do meal prep every weekend to save on cost.
"Honestly, the cost of living in Singapore is actually very good.

I suggest you spend a bit of time working overseas - it will change your perception."
"Hawker prices can increase 2x and singaporean lifestyles still won't change. Its the mid to high end restaurants and alcohol that is extremely expensive, even more so than other developed countries. Coupled with the fact that rent is so expensive here really makes a huge blow to the quality of life of those who dont have their own place.

Having lived in several other developed countries before, although eating out is expensive, alcohol is cheap and rent is much more affordable. We could invite friends for home parties if we dont want to spend a fortune out. Most singaporeans cannot do this until they are old enough to buy a HDB."
"I measure costs in gold and, increasingly, in bitcoin. There is no point measuring it in fiat currency anymore. 

In gold and bitcoin terms, it is coming down."
"Cost of living rising may be inevitable as you say, but depressed wages are not. The reason we feel the rising costs is because wages are not rising fast enough to match.


And the pace of cost increase has been dramatic as we import rich immigrants who have contributed to rising home prices, a key component of our living costs. 


Locals simply are at a cost disadvantage compared to foreigners who can afford to retire comfortably in their homelands after earning SGD for decades. 


Being born Singaporean today is turning out to be a disadvantage compared to those born earlier. "
"Yea inflation is a global thing, and sg alr managed it quite well with strengthening the currency the past few years. Wondering if there’re other mechanisms that could help manage inflation further."
"Not much opportunity to go overseas to work compared to the past. 

Vietnam? Companies prefer to hire born-Vietnamese (who got fully paid ASEAN/MOE/NUS/NTU scholarships courtesy of Singapore tax-payers) who graduated from Singapore universities and are now “Singaporean” PRs and send them to Vietnam. 

Thailand? Same as above

Indonesia? Same as top 

Philippines? Same as top

China? Same as top

India? Same as top

Malaysia? Same as top plus already got over 1m Malaysians eagerly working in Singapore “to create jobs for Singaporeans” 

Best way is get parent scholarship to go to immigration friendly countries like Australia, study there, and work there for some years before HQ decided to post back to Singapore."
SG food is cheap esp when you talk about hawker but it is unhealthy and of low quality.. So while other countries might be higher in food prices. You have to see the quality in return as well. Most things in SG are of premium price but average quality..

"The thing is if everyone spends less on wants, it will depress the economy, causing less money to be available, which causes people to cut back even more... You get the idea.

I feel there's a disjunct between common wisdom and economics."
agreed... and speaking of train tracks ... our leaders are still thinking new train lines actually help with all this where in fact new lines will totally pump cost of property/labour/transport/renovation and increase price of living... yet i see so many comments on social media cheering them on ...
"I think $10 is a bit of a stretch but no la I don't think it's necessarily $20 ykwim.

Like I think food court/hawker centre can be a $6 main, <$2 coffee? is (within) $8?

Breakfast is like, I don't usually think of it as a ""daily"" thing. I think of it as a \_weekly\_ thing. So eg pack of 4 buns, eat over 2 days. Pack of biscuits/cereal bars, eat over a week.

So it evens out to a not-too-high per-day cost haha."
"Nope, chaipng prices has gone ham. 1 meat (4-5 small pieces) and 1 vege for 3.80 like wtf"
"I'm actually considering Caring Pharmacy delivery from JB tbh but I don't know what's the delivery cost haha.


Its cheaper to buy bathroom stuff (dental, hair, bath, pads, etc) in Msia but then either you have to go from time to time and/or if you handcarry on a day trip then u can't get v many things 


I don't know the delivery costs though! Caring website just says to whatsapp. I've ordered from small businesses in other parts of Msia before for a flat shipping rate of abt $8, but those are like not more than 1kg, not 1kg per bottle of body wash. Haha."
"Tbh if your concerns are vibrancy, diversity and authenticity then you're already well off enough to not be actually impacted by rising cost of living."
"You're looking at it wrong. Since the cakes and hawker meals went up by 60% overall, meaning everything else probably also increased by 60%, that extra $400/mth isn't remotely going to cut it. $400 a month increase in salary is nowhere near 60% of our salary."
"A guy who lost 131milion dollars in bitcoins to scam.  Or the other guy losing 32 million and 1 more 22million in bitcoins all to scam.

"Everyone keep saying kopi price increase solely because of GST but they don't know coffee bean price has also increased like MAD. Not only kopitiam robusta coffee, arabica too.

The price has increased by almost 400%. A cup of kopi main ingredient is still kopi bean."
"In theory, the way to manage inflation is cut spending etc to shrink the economy. How given our unique population dynamics and nature of our economy, doing so will disproportionately hurt the average working class family more than intended."
Choosing not to raise a regressive tax could have helped manage inflation.
"Haha that day during peak hour it was RM45 Southkey to Mount Austin. That's 11km


That's Punggol MRT to Serangoon MRT if the MRT breaks down and I decide to cab


Um tf. 


Granted it was definitely peak pricing (took an hour for the Grab to arrive, highway jam was nuts), but 45bucks for Punggol to Serangoon is crazy


But peak pricing aside (yes la surge pricing close one eye close two eyes la)


L'Or nespresso pods is $7.95 in SG. It's RM21.90, which is like ... SGD $6.65. But I sure as heck am not paying 21.90 for INSTANT coffee if that was my currency


Gonna get smacked for this but I legit feel q privileged when I realise (1) sub 4k salary in SGD is alr 5fig in MYR and (2) the few hundreds (SGD) we bring for the weekend getaway is the Watsons employee's entire monthly wage


how sia?!


**Edit:** not me also realising that same RM21.90/SGD $6.65 pays for one box of discounted retainer cleaner from Caring Pharmacy. Because the non-discount price is RM 23.45 now. (I would know. I bought .. 4 .. for the next 2mo lol)


Heck bro imagine your RETAINER CLEANER and INSTANT COFFEE costing the same. And as someone earning in the SGD, $10.50 SGD for retainer cleaner makes me weep a bit, that's why I pay RM 21.90 (~37% discount) - imagine paying twice of that in dollar to dollar.


Can strip off the coffee for sure but retainer is the teeth equivalent of contact lense necessity levels bro. Its literally teef pyjamas."
It is not fair to simply look at CPI numbers across different countries and draw comparisons because they all have different methodologies and weightages in their calculation.
China CPI goes by 100%. Alway up and down at 100% line. Their inflation rate is -0.7% which our country could never reach.
Confirmed must be someone who lives in an area already serviced by a good train station and benefiting from the price premium.
">Since the cakes and hawker meals went up by 60% overall, meaning everything else probably also increased by 60%,

That's not how it works. You are incorrectly trying to extrapolate a vastly exaggerated number. First, hawker food going up by 60% doesn't mean housing and other essentials also went up 60%. Second, hawkers did not increase their prices by 60% in 2 years."
"Nope sorry that does not fit the narrative. GTFO with your stats and facts. Its always and only the government’s fault for gst, inflation, me being a jobless bbfa

/s"
"the fact that not only coffee price raise because of GST. EVERYTHING raised because of GST!

I do understand inflation is global, but GST is not global leh! Really need to increase GST at this point of time??"
"It could, but eventually tax would have to be raised for more gov spending. This could come either from income tax or gst"
"My last paragraph did mention “immigrant friendly countries like Australia”. Australia and friendly western countries will probably be the only realistic options for native Singaporeans and parental sponsorship may be needed to help with easing in, such as studying there for a bachelor first. 

Of course there will be exceptional talents who can graduate from a local university, find a job overseas fast,  immediately move there and adapt quickly but I think these are the minority.

PS: Overseas education could cost 200k-500k easily inclusive of accommodation, depending on countries. Quite bleak for HDB proletariat kids in household of less than 10k monthly income."
"Ok sure, there are differences in the basket of goods selected and the weightage + timing differences.

So then what would you recommend as a metric for measuring general inflation? And what makes it more effective than the generally accepted standard that is CPI?"
"I'm actually agreeing to your point higher cost of living = need for higher salaries, BUT in order to have real income growth, one needs to improve in productivity. Do not confuse with higher cost of living = company have to pay you higher salaries.

Basically the measurement for Labour productivity is the value of goods and services produced by each hour of labour. Hence, high labor productivity signifies efficient resource allocation and allows for increased output with the same or fewer resource. As productivity rises, countries can afford to increase wages and improve living standards without sacrificing competitiveness."

Chicken!"
Those are legitimate concerns but nothing to do with cost of living
"The hawker meals going up in price isn't the main problem, it's a symptom. If something as low as hawker meals are going up, it means the things that are more expensive like groceries, rent and housing are going up as well, if not higher."
"That's true, the inflation of different goods increase at different paces and rates. But the main point of the topic is that if things as basic as hawker centre meals increased in price, everything above that would increase as well, if not more.

You're right, housing and essentials didn't just increase by 60%. It was more.

While the base price of hawker food on average increased from $3-5 (60% increase) over the past 20 years, the average price of a resale flat in Singapore went from $200,000 to $612,000 (200%+ increase). It really doesn't take pHd-level of calculations to infer that hawker centre meals getting $2 more expensive isn't the problem, it's the fact that everything got so much more expensive that EVEN the cheapest thing in the chain of necessities, hawker centre meals, are getting more expensive."
"LKY's stance on taxes needing to be raised, is the government not spending within its means.

Our reserves keep going up, but numbers must only increase right? Even during COVID."
"Unless hdb start to buy land at cash cost or they properly account for profits made on hdb enbloc or when hdb land is taken for more intensive commercial/pte residential debt (like holland V). Then the E$7 billion deficit at hdb will disappear. 

Which means the govt now has $7 billion more to spend. Which means that govt can REDUCE gst so that they don’t make such a huge operating surplus!"
"first, he will probably cut foreign talent by at least 30%, then he will increase wage for everyone, then he will abolish cpf and waive off casino levy fee for locals and PR. Then he will subsidies HDB even more and build more HDB/houses."
"That's not wrong, efficiency is the key. Ideally, you'd have a few god-level skilled workers that can single-handedly push up the production of your company, boosting your company's economic value.

The question is: How much can you realistically expect a few workers to do before it's either unrealistic or teeters on workplace abuse? and How do you expect to hire said skilled workers if the salary you offer is low? They'll get swept up by the companies that pay more, as the market demands.

In an environment with low cost of living, perhaps a worker might not sweat the differences in salary so much and would decide based on the company they like more. But in an environment with a high cost of living, their decision-making process on which company to work on is heavily influenced by whichever is willing to pay them enough to earn a living, because the stakes are higher.

You're expecting money to come because productivity will increase. You're not considering how you're going to increase productivity without money."
Wah… you buy expensive frozen food…
"Life is extremely expensive as a single person, more than a dual income couple with access to multiple tax breaks and subsidised early access to housing plus economies of scale for groceries etc. these concerns affect everything.

I may as well be a foreigner elsewhere, it’s the same as being a single minority here."
"But the prices of hawker meals haven’t increased for like 10 years? Whereas the prices of all the other stuff you mentioned have always been increasing.

I see the increase in prices of hawker meals more as a correction. It’s not even reasonable to expect hawkers to break even based on prices that are 10 years old"
"First, OP is talking about prices in the last 1-2 years, hence me quoting the $400/mo increase in the last 2 years. Why are you bringing in a 20 year time frame? Second, median salaries went from 2000 to 5500 in 20 years outpacing hdb price growth, which is also not the point."
"They have though. Not too long ago, there was a time where most hawker meals hovered around $2. Now, even chicken rice is often $4 and above.

And exactly, you're right, it's not reasonable to expect hawkers to break even on prices that are 10 years old. They need to make a living and eat too. The problem is that they used to be able to do so comfortably with lower prices back then, but now they can't, to the point they have to raise prices or close up shop. It's a smoking gun that shows that very necessary things in our lives are overall getting a lot more expensive."
"It was to your very point that hawkers didn’t increase their prices by 60% in 2 years. Fair enough, so I went back as far as possible to see how long it took to increase 60% from and took the values from there. It was responding to the very point you made, why are you backpedaling now?

Oh, and $2000-$5500 is not outpacing the HDB growth rate. Look at the math again."
"Buddy, it's not that deep. You pulled a 60% increase in cost of living out of your ass regarding a comment about hawkers increasing prices in the last 1-2 years. And then had to go back 20 years to defend that number. This thread ain't about 20 years ago."
"If if you knew how to read, you could see that I pulled the 60% from the numbers already stated. And then you questioned that that growth happened in the past 1-2 years. I concurred with that, so I fact-checked and brought up the actual duration that created that amount of growth.

The crux of all the points listed so far is that **even if cheap things got slightly more expensive, that extra $400/mo increase in median income isn't going to do shit because everything else is even more expensive**. This is basic reading comprehension. It's okay to admit that you misunderstood what you read, you know. Rather than doubling down on defending yourself."
"It made me spend $13,500 to run for election to fight for y'all"
"Not really, i feel that its the big ticket items that really crush you , like housing , insurance, medical /dental expenses, not the day to day stuff. I have colleagues in many different parts of the world, including 6 other countries in asia and the cost of living sentiment is the same or even worse.. No one is immune unless they don't rely on imported goods/products or unless you live in Japan where inflation has been historically low (but income growth is also non-existent)"
"Already eating home so still can make some savings, prices are still ok if your working or have someone support you but prices are not ok for those who can’t work or from a poorer background."
I paid 500k more than the last owner for my resale hdb and will take 25 years to pay it off while emptying my cash and CPF during the initial down payment that’s how it has affected me
Just spend loh. No choice
"honestly if u are earning a decent income its still manageable. but what abt those earning minimal/below median wages? ever since i moved out and started getting my own food/groceries, i've seen how prices increase. Eggs went from like 4bucks to 7bucks; sliced cheese went from 10bucks to 14bucks; sausages went from 9bucks to 12/13bucks. Ofc I look out for promotions and buy during those times, but these price increases took place in the last 2years. % wise they are quite significant no?? Imagine u are a dad/mum trying to feed ur kids and grocery/hawker prices keep increasing, it is gonna be a strain and it also means less savings for rainy days."
"Honestly, all the first world city faces the same issue.

Korea, Japan, Beijing, HK, New York, & etc.

At least our housing, education, & medical is subsidised.

Advise is to invest lo. Rather than hoping your salary increase can match inflation, investing is something you can control."
"are you a man or woman? asking coz you going to live with your in laws. I think for woman generally just harder - mainly due to chores. most kids have been treated like kings / queens and don't do chores at all. while mothers are happy (or tolerate would be the word) to continue doing chores for their sons, they aren;t happy to also do the same for their daughters in laws. Which I understand. so the mothers either stop doing for their sons once the DIL lives with them, but sons just don't do it either! so the mothers get mad coz omg, the house is now a pigsty. or the mothers (to me wrongly) expects the DIL to do the sons and their own chores. which makes a lot of angst for the DIL. or the mother just decides to continue for the son but not the DIL, which makes the DIL angst coz she isn't considered ""part of the family"". OR the mother sucks it up and does chores for both usually very unwillingly. 

  
solution - sons should be more aware and suck it up. but I dunno why that is rare. probably as majority of men can't seem to see that there is something that needs to be done now! or maybe its more of like man and woman have different view of how much needs to be done, and how urgently it needs to be done. 

so I would say, just make sure you got enough money to be self sufficient and live in your own BTO when it arrives. 

how does cost of living affect me? I am now doing IF and cutting down on unnecessary eating."
Whose kopi cost $1. The kopis at my coffeeshops cost $1.50 and milo peng is $2 plus.
More conscientious with tracking my expenditure and differentiating between my needs and wants
"Eating more outside as cooking at home according to my mum because it is more time consuming and also more expensive since cooking usually waste alot of food as cannot eat finish , and hmm not really that delicious also .

Eating outside the portion just nice ,more convinient and save alot time.

Other than that , same because I don't whack money on buying useless things , go holidays and buy car ."

"I’m fully wfh so thankfully shielded from many COL increases like food prices, transport, clothing lol. Took HDB loan for house so the interest and monthly payment is fixed. 

I still noticed the increase in grocery and utility bills though. But overall still within affordability for myself. 

I’m grateful that my phone bill is low at $10/m, I remember the days when it used to be $60-70 under 2y contracts."
Food prices don’t affect me. High property prices (and the ultra low BTO income ceiling did). I had to buy private for my first property. Yes I could have done resale but I would be overpaying with my money going into the hands of BTO profiteers who would take the cash and buy a condo with it anyway
Nego with boss that pay raise needs to be far more than inflation

"Everyone and every country experiencing this. Just have to deal with it.

"Prices are still alright, I can somewhat see that they are controlling the price of fruits, vegetables, rice, oil and eggs. Discounts are given quite often for longer periods of time for groceries.

I don't drink kopi or eat hawker fare too often but I do see the price increase. Maybe as a mindless drone working in CBD area, paying $7-$20 for lunch/dinner is normal to me.

Not buying house or car, I'm comfortable enough to survive but not that rich."
"Jeremy, authentic and refreshing insights. you are perhaps speaking out on behalf of the incumbents who know the issue but have no balls to tackle this due to the political cost. Regardless of the election outcome, I hope you'll continue to be actively involved in our political scene, contributing your ideas and passion. On another note, since you're saying Bitcoin as a retirement tool, I'm curious about your thoughts on the various products available in the market these days. I've noticed companies like MicroStrategy investing solely in Bitcoin. In your view, which is the better investment for retirement: ETFs or stocks of such companies?"
And people who blame the government need to realise that it’s a global problem. Not unique to Singapore. In fact Singapore’s inflation rate has been very well controlled compared to the rest of the world.
Yup Canadians friends are telling me everyday it's crazy they can't even save any penny after rent due to high taxes
"Problem with this is, the countries you mentioned, theyre are all in big countries, they have outskirts and rural places to live that doesnt cost as much as the City and if you cannot make it in the city you can always flock back to the small towns and outskirts. We cannot compare that and many of our current leaders keep boasting about Singapore vs said city. We dont have an outskirt, we dont have a rural space, our country is a city-state itself and yet we are forced to pay so much for housing and its not fair for us because we as a citizens are stuck in this city itself with no where to go unless moving out to another country as a whole. The govt keeps forgetting about this and trying to put themself at a pedestal that our housing is affordable when it is not at all even for a BTO."
If he is living with his in-laws that means his wife is living with her parents…
"You are one of those who do not understand and not talking sense. A lot of our inflation are self infected by our dear PAP. Prices of goods are high partly because RENT keep increasing and who is the BIGGEST landlord in Singapore? Go check. 

Increasing GST twice within a short span gives another excuse for businesses to increase prices twice!

Yes other countries also have inflation BUT ours is help along by our dear government full of smart scholars, elite and generals. The other countries also DO NOT have ministers drawing millions of salary doing a part time job.

Time to wake up."
Please don’t act as if raising gst had nothing to do with it. yes there is inflation around the world but everyone took the opportunity to jack up prices more than 2% thanks to the way the gst hike was implemented.
"I realised something is that most of them really have to rely on renting in western country?

there are some tiktok video about random street interview to see their flat or something but the question is always ""How much do you pay for rental"" instead of ""how much do you pay for the house/flat"" for every person and only 1 out of like 30 will say ""I own the house"" and they be like WOAH"
"Like you mentioned, Singapore is a city state, so of course we have to compare the data to other city states. As for outskirts/rural areas, we’re just unlucky that our country is small and we can’t blame anyone for that. 

And BTO as a whole is still affordable, it’s just cause you’re looking at the upper quartile price range that’s why it seems unaffordable. If you were to zoom out and look at the lower quartile price range, you’ll see a 4rm BTO going for less than $400k, which is the same as houses in the outskirts/rural in another developed country! And I haven’t even mention about the housing subsidies that the government provides"
"yeah, to be fair I dunno if its a male privilege or what lah. 

its a fact of life that very few children do their chores now. whether its helper or never trained when young or coz tuition / enrichment whatever keeps them so busy, they grow into kidults that don't do chores, dont buy groceries, have no clue on how a house is maintained, don't know don't care about utilities bills etc and just don't clean up after themselves. 

its a problem when you go live with someone's else house! and then most get oh so sensitive when told they need to pull their own weight in chores, supporting the house and its maintenance."

"The price hikes (of 10-30% in the past few years) are precisely due to global inflation and increased costs of raw materials, labour, rental etc. worldwide. The prices would have increased even without GST increase. If GST is to be increased, high inflation periods are the best time to do so because consumers are highly sensitive to large price hikes (both inflationary and GST) and businesses are cautious not to hike more than the inflationary pressures on their cost of business. 

During low inflation periods, the 2% GST would have given businesses an excuse to increase their prices to fudge it with the GST increase, even if the costs of their raw materials etc have not increased."
"\>4rm BTO going for less than $400k, which is the same as houses in the outskirts/rural in another developed country! 

you're right and also wrong.

in another developed country outside of some developed countries 400k i can get a decent 1 floor 4 room house with a nice lawn and backyard and the house are super spacious. You cannot compare 400k worth of pigeon hole that HDB build with 400k house outside of a major city in Australia, Europe or America."
"You said it yourself. 

That men and women both have differing sense of urgency on different things. If it's something that you think is urgent, but he doesn't, then do it yourself. If he thinks something is urgent, let him do it.

"Can let me know how much you spend in total before your receipt gets picked on the show? And the odds of you getting 1000x? Instead of putting your eggs in a single company, you can own REITs to indirectly own commercial properties/malls and receiving dividends, no? 

Now air seems like a luxury to you."
"One of the things I disagree with the govt would be the increase of GST.

While I understand the need to collect tax more revenue, the way to do it should be to improve the overall economy and increase everyone's standard of living, which translates to higher disposable income & GS taxable spending. Increase of GST is a lazy solution of just taking a bigger slice of the cake, rather than making the cake bigger.

That said, I do not think the oppositions have any better solution to this beyond the voicing of useless rhetoric of ""SAY NO TO GST INCREASE"" which is essentially just a performative gesture."
"that's fine if its the son and DIL having their own house - they can discuss and decide. 

but living in another's person house? 

that is different - if the son thinks its life as normal despite his wife living there, he will just continue to do zero chores, leading to the unhappy situation I described."
"Public housing is supposed to be affordable which you dont need to pay until you retire, and the light of that the PM was telling us that our HDB asset will be our retirement money instead of the CPF. This is another shift in the goal post, they use this exploit to gas light us *""oh its ok to sell your house for millions at 70 yrs old, this is your retirement money! sell for more!""* isnt that really a bad choice of words for a very volatile housing issue already?

There are choices, either you get out of the country and live else where

or vote for the right people to challenge these issues and fix it. for yourself and for your children."
"Low cost of living means low income, why would people go there. If low income, where else is better to live at than singapore where hdb is like so readily available, with world class infrastructure in a financial hub like Singapore.
If you got money, u would go higher living standard place for work, if not the company where got money to afford your salary.
People don't just travel for the sake of travelling. Why go all the way to some unknown country just to live there, just don't make much sense."
"Nope, you’re wrong. Lots of locals migrated to lower cost countries as well as lower cost of living of other countries.

It’s more likely your social circle is too small and you do not know as much as you think you do. Either that, or you’re the one who are only focusing on the higher qualify of life area and thus ignorance of the other area of a country."
"So what's truly your point though? Are you actually trying to find out or just want to ask in bad faith, be cynical, and shit on every response towards your question? 

What a weirdo... maybe you can be that ""special"" one and go to rural or low cost of living areas to work and earn big bucks or lead a carefree life, then share your experience and journey here so Singaporeans can learn from you?"
"Cuz HCOL pays higher and usually can be argued that if u save properly the overall take home is more. And ultimately that all that matters.

"When younger you want to migrate to a place where you can earn same or batter than in your home country, when retiring, low cost/ income countries become more attractive."
Cos they migrate for the economic opportunities. Hugh cost of living is a correlation.
"You actually earn more even after factoring in high cost of living.

For example England has a house interest rate of 4.7 to 5%. 
You can earn 100k salary, minus off taxes is 75k. (Around 6.2k monthly) 
Subtract around 2.2k housing instalment for 25 year loan 500k housing and you still have alot of money left."
"Its not about cost of living, its about quality of life. For third world countries, sure you can live like a king but you have to constantly worry about security and food cleanliness. Also people who migrate tend to be on the richer end, to them the increase in col is not as impt"
"Quality of life.. better surroundings and all that 

Why would one want to go to a polluted and crowded place with low cost of living when the purchasing power parity of your wages is the same as a place which is clean and peaceful?"
"Bro you been to Darwin? Adelaide probably too laid back for SG and mostly Ang Moh food. Sydney and Melbourne you still get good food, life style good and high income jobs around so if you can afford to buy property cash then cost of living is fine and the money spent is good investment.
  
I’m from Melbourne and most of what you eat here can also get decent version in Melbourne it’s just $15 instead of $5."
You need to go where the jobs are. And where the jobs are tend to be the ones with high cost of living. Why do you think Malaysians go to Singapore even though it has a higher cost of living?
"Situation and answer could be different between age groups, e.g. those who migrate in 20s vs 50s."
"In my experience, I have tried to find jobs in brisbane and it was hard to find. I didnt say arent any, but just hard to find one. While in sydney or melb job offers are literally everywhere. 

I had one friend try to find jobs in darwin because of cheap and direct flight from his hometown. But Ends up in melbs....."
"Can’t speak for the UK, but I personally moved to the US for grad school. Simple answer is the best schools in the US are mostly located on the HCOL coasts, and Singaporeans who move here for school tend to find a community where they studied at, and therefore, a job here in the same area.

Others have also noted that most high wage white collar jobs are found in HCOL areas; and the simple math here is that the HCOL-LCOL wage difference **outweighs** the HCOL-COL difference in COL.

Anecdotally, a typical (probably lower than median) wage in the SF Bay Area is about 100k USD per annum, which leaves you with a take home of about 84k after taxes. At my company, the median wage is 300k per annum. It’s also common practice for companies to offer vastly different wages for the **EXACT SAME** job (my company offers 180k for a SWE role in the bay area/NYC, but only 80k outside of both metropolitan areas). 

In comparison, you’d be hard pressed to even find a job at the same experience level paying 80k pre-tax in a LCOL area in the US (even at the best companies in the country), and factoring in taxes leaves you with about 67k USD post-tax. 

So, unless the COL difference is at least 17k per year, it wouldn’t make financial sense to move to a LCOL place and start anew. Even if the COL difference is more than 17k a year, there are lots of immaterial advantages that HCOL places have over LCOL places (after all, HCOL places are HCOL for a reason — people like living there). 

In the SF bay area, that’s the perfect 15 degrees weather everyday, and the abundance of green spaces and authentic asian food (if you believe that California is a dangerous hellscape, please stop watching Fox News and I urge you to visit SF for just a day); in NYC, it’s the city that never sleeps. 

You may save more at the end of the day if you get a remote job that pays a HCOL wage, but move to a LCOL place to live, but that’s extremely tough in this job market today. 

So, as with all things emigration, the question it boils down to is—**are you happy living and working where you are; and are you happy earning the wage that you do while living in said place?**"
"Singaporean in California.  
  
Personally for me, why would I leave Singapore if it's not for a higher paying job? Tbh SG life is near perfection for me, albeit the terrible humidity/weather.

Safe, clean, convenient, efficient.

But I think it's up to the individual because not everyone cares about salary but more about the quality of life. Not everyone likes Singapore's rat race, fast pace."
"To emigrate, you often need an employment visa sponsored by an employer. Those sponsors are usually businesses in the major cities with a strong local economy (and high cost of living).

In the UK, the economy is very London centric. There are not many competitive jobs or employment opportunities elsewhere in the southwest (Cornwall or even Bristol) and the northeast (Teeside and Tyne). If you don't want to go to London, the only other place with a half decent economy is Manchester and possibly Birmingham."
"
Except the people I know that migrate to lower cost countries all are retired or semi retired"
"
The thing is, even people who i know who are still in Singapore and want to migrate never dream of migrating to a low cost city and yet complain about the cost of living in Singapore when they can migrate to a low cost city"
"Yeah but you have to live in England

More seriously, a 100K GBP salary puts you at the 96th percentile of UK earners, and that includes London salaries heavily skewing things upwards. That’s like 68K take home 

A cheap, run-down house in /Bradford/ is 200K, so you’re running at least a grand a month just in payments

Rather make 68K in SG then, won’t get stabbed"
"If its due to quality of life, then why are huge number of people living in california for example,  leaving the state permanently to go to lower cost states ?"
Because the countryside's cost of living are relatively lower than the major city/states in the US.
"People tend to move up the ladder. The allure of western county with safety, job security and better living standards. Unless you're posted by your company or poached to the place.. a high sal that you can enjoy the standard of living.

Would you ever choose to work in the Philippines or Indonesia with the local pay? Unless it's some charity or unique situation. I doubt you would wish to. Their locals already want to get out of their country.

Complaining about high cost is normal. It not like the locals in the""high"" standard of living you are talking about are not complaining."
"Yup. Agreed. But I can foresee more people ""migrating"" to jb soon, after RTS link is done.

Rent out your hdb here in sg, rent a cheaper apartment in jb"
"Affordability?

I hear that no one can afford to pay the rent there anymore"
It's subjective for different individuals what quality of life means to them.
"You see for all these GREEDY grab and taxi company, they can charge the drivers up to $200 per day for vehicle rental. Pretty much the first 10+ trips you drive is used to pay for rent only. Worked till you die..."
"Rest in peace, selfless father. When Platform act was implemented this year, workers need to work 20% longer just to maintain the same take home pay. How not to overwork. Put in CPF Medisave got what use? Die means die. RIP. I hope the children are fine. The system has failed you… 😢"
"***""he did not smoke, drink or spend lavishly""***  
  
The system makes people work and work. It is broken. Our government condones this. It's time for Universal Basic Income people. Push for it in schools, in parliament, in government. You'd thank me for it later.

We should fight for greater **equitability** instead of allowing millionaires / billionaires to purchase GCBs and what not. A billionaire earns millions by month, while some common folks broke his body for a few thousand with many more hours put in work than the billionaire.

Wake up people, wake up Singapore. See what late capitalism is doing - it is rewarding the rich while punishing the poor.

Don't tell me the nonsense that this guy deserved it bcos he chose this path."
"While it’s easy to blame our high cost of living, we should accept that all results are correlated to choices we make. If you choose to live by the sword, then you die by the sword."
"My condolences.. his death just gave me a strong reminder not to have kids in singapore.. with the high cost of living, no kids will reduce stress significantly"
"so not pap's fault but the citizens who dared asked why isn't the gov doong anything to control costs??

16 hrs a day is crazy. Such a tragic story. Hope people will learn their lessons not to overwork themselves as they will not have enough life to spend the money.
"The tragedy is he is lucky or rather the family is lucky that he had the stroke and passed away, instead of ending up bedridden with all the hefty medical bills to follow…"
"meanwhile political holders earn huge salary which they justify as ""matching the private sector"".

So the rest of us earning low wages are not humans liao?"
Why can't Grab pay a living wage salary for their Grab drivers? So sad that they hv to overwork just to get by. 
"There is a spectrum of people, from poor to rich. The poor can look for assistance and aids from the government to cope with Cost of Living. 

There are also CDC vouchers to help Singaporeans.

I think it is unfair to use this example to say that there are more and more Singaporeans coping with high Cost of Living. There could be underlying medical conditions. Lifestyle (smoking, drinking) plays a part too. 

On the other end of the spectrum, there are many Singaporeans travelling overseas for holidays. Can I say more and more Singaporeans are not affected by the high Cost of Living?"
"Every sector, there’s death caused by several factors. This person is a hard worker, and he is aiming for a change for his next generation. Looking at the tier that he is achieving, he is the top worker, and he understands in order to make more, you need to work more. To put the blame for cost of living, I think that’s an uncontrollable situation. He took the challenge, however, he underestimate his ailing health. I hope he does have life coverage for his family, May him rest in peace."
ppl still choose to rent instead of buying cars so companies can buy up more cars to rent out as they bid for higher COEs. in the end the drivers who rent and the customers are the ones paying for the COEs.
And why not you own fleets and rent our?
"So weird that we don't talk about UBI. If there is any place that can afford it, it is probably us. So much capital wasting on bad spending. Somehow when channeling back to us, and we are ruining the country."
"UBI? Nah fuck off with that shit

There will be plenty of ppl who will abuse this and not work and Im not gonna pay more taxes to fund them. Granted we spend alot on stupid things already but spending more on other stupid things isn't the right solution either

If you cant afford to have kids then dont have them. All of this seems to result from his own choices, cant really blame anyone for it"
"How much does an adult need to comfortably live in SG? Say $3-4k/mth. How much additional per mth does he need to support 2 kids and finish their uni education in SG? 

An average grab driver net earns $3-4k after all expenses.  CDC vouchers don't come monthly. It would have been very tough for a single income to sustain the family by driving average hours. 

So arguably yes we can say the cost of living is very high."
"Must be one of those high flyers who is earning a lot and for now need not worry about livelihood. When something happens, then only this person will understand. Talk is free. You think we can use CDC to pay bills and loans."
"Yea I did, and I added a message nice chat bro. He kept asking me get bto bto he also give me unsolicited advice."
"Just a reminder that the govt thought it prudent to spend a hair under $1B to build both the ~~LKY~~ Founders’ Memorial and NS Square (not including running costs and upkeep), along with another near-1B on keeping SPH afloat. And god knows what other stupid stuff they’re wasting money on each year. All this could have otherwise gone towards a better security net for low-income families, but noOoOoOo, gotta keep the rakyat on their toes at all times."
"But these rich people end up being taxed less! SG taxes are low, no COE for additional cars they drive, landed home all have EV chargers they pay less for petrol, got solar panels can even sell back electricity to offset monthly bills … got even climate vouchers!!! "
"individual responsibility? Singapore is overpriced, he was just set up to be constantly working with little support in an unsustainable Society to merely “Surviving”, This is sad and a warning sign."
"It’s an observation. We can be in denial that the rising cost of living is not directly/indirectly responsible for the declining birth rates.

I’m honestly glad that people who don’t feel like they are in a position to have a family choose not to. A family built on stilts is just going to strain and crumble."
"Yes, but SG government has already done quite abit in this space to ensure mandatory CPF contribution vs in the past where everything is self reported. Also raising minimum age to be a grab driver etc.

Also the question is how much government intervention do we want in this space? Not every single driver would want more government oversight/ control.
There is only so much that government can intervene currently. 

For these companies, if they are exploiting legal loopholes and drivers and customer choose to be participants who can you blame? There is always the option of going back to taxi only but as a customer the experience is terrible, as a driver you get cost pressure as well on rental which the taxi companies can raise without rebuke as well. Covid and the drop in taxi driver interest forced the taxi companies to slash their rental cost to like 60% (can’t recall what’s the discount atm since it was during Covid). 

End of the day Taxi company or ride hailing, the cost pressure felt by the driver is the same. If the industry pay sucks as a driver, they need to (as a contractor) decide what is in their best interest. 16h a day driving or move into another profession with better health benefits but lower pay (assuming out of the market for quite awhile and skill set is not current)."
"It’s a catch 22 situation. In the first place, will having kids stop the influx of foreigners in the first place? The root cause is cheap foreign labor. This is going to happen regardless of the number of kids you have. Our obsession for profit at all cost has led us down this path."
That's no longer the case apparently. I don't know the stats but people are saying that many foreigners are taking high paying positions now
"Wow I don’t even earn that amount and I’m a Singaporean alive and kicking.
Over inflated costs of living in the article"

"Actually if its high for expats, govt should be very concerned since they always promulgated that singapore need foreigners. So if these foreigners leave due to high cost of living, govt will lose their precious FTs lol."
"If you don't eat hawker carby fried crap and have to pay for your kid's education with no subsidies, then the numbers are correct. 
We all know Singapore is crazy expensive, yet you try to convince yourselves it's all good."
"Insurance for the family would come up to about $1k a month.

Preschool for 2 kids is about $1k after subsidies. 

Enrichment for English, berries Chinese enrichment is $1k.

Learn to swim and multisports exposure is $1k. 

set aside $1k a month for family holidays

$1k a month for groceries and family supplies. 

$2k for each adult for transport, eating out, see Dr, pay taxes, buy gifts, etc. 

on top of all these, each adult has to save at least $1k a month for bare bones retirement. 

To live below this $10k threshold means the children must be intelligent to learn everything themselves, super athletic so they can qualify for school cca selection, and everyone at home must be super healthy so no need insurance."
"Of course not. Singapore's cost of living situation has been managed. 

That's why we have time to spend on better things like trials of lying about a liar (according to the liar), and other silly distractions like pofma."
"Link to Singapore's listing: https://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/country_result.jsp?country=Singapore

Rent is severely inflated"
"It's fake cos we have GST vouchers, COL vouchers and CDC vouchers! So we should be at the bottom because we have vouchers!


/S"
Strange SG dollar so strong yet Our prices of Goods are way higher than others. Pharmacy is practically monopolise by 2 Co. Gua... & U.. y. Insane prices. Gua.. can sell_ buy 1 get  1 free yet can cover cost price.
$50 cannot buy much now…every election knn kaopeh kaobu if high cost of living and NOTHING change at all…in fact become worser
"daily necessities are higher than before covid but generally still manageable. the real expensive stuff are usually discretionary spending and vices, eg housing cars cigarettes liquor"
"Meaningless numbers when you have no footnotes to detail what ‘costs’ you are comparing. Singapore’s rental or private transportation is on the higher end especially for foreigners, but costs of food and other expenses remain affordable. This is especially so with significant subsidies for local residents in healthcare."
Op is an idiot. The price includes beer and a VW golf.
Most Expats do not need to pay for their rent or house as its provided by company
You are just consuming not living. There is a great difference between those that insist on Ridout residence and those that throw a housewarming party for a slave quarters HDB slum estates BTO smaller than the bathroom at Ridout.  
You want the government to lower the cost of living…. for expats?
"Enrichment and swimming classes are totally optional. If we want to conduct cost of living survey we shouldn’t have factor that in by design. 

Even if you say it’s practically necessary, it’s because the other household are doing it and you felt left behind otherwise. You yourself choose to enroll your kid on the rat race."
"Whether you agree or disagree with the incumbent it’s a bullcrap number. 

I am renting and living above median standard of living and it’s not even close to that per month.

Second is nobody spends $3000 per month in Jakarta or KL, let alone a typical household earn that much."
"The numbers are crowd sourced. I don't think they are fake. More like expats shop at super atas locations, resulting in higher prices.

Some of the numbers are quite accurate though. For example 1kg of oranges on RedMart is around the same price as that stated on the website."
"Honestly, rent isn’t high enough. In places like Sentosa and Keppel, a 2br would set you back easy 5k."
"Not really inflated. But the problem is that “apartment purchase” does not seem to reflect HDB prices. And “apartment in the city” in Singapore is going to mean near CBD, whereas in other countries, Jurong might still count as “in the city” because the whole of Singapore is one city by external standards.

Also, the inclusion of car in the basket of goods.

$2818 rent for one bedroom apartment (not room) isn’t too crazy."
"$5800 rent, $3500 school. No food or anything included."
Cost of food affordable? You must be kidding unless youre talking about hawker street food only. Which is insane to eat it every day.
"Lol, the 90s are calling and want your comment back. At most you can get a small cost of living adjustment if your company needs you to move here. Most expats come voluntarily and pay for their own rent."
Reply to a wrong comment? Cause if anything the previous comment is implying singaporean are living fine due to gov providing subsidies to lower the cost of living for us
"This seasia stats always post inaccuracies in their articles and content. You will find all sorts of comments from people living in the different Asian cities saying the ranking and numbers are inaccurate.

"I think every parent in a non branded pre school knows as a fact that your child is fucked in primary school these days if they still cannot read and write in 2 languages by primary one. And regular pre schools are not ensuring that they are ready for primary one. 

Knowing how to swim is so basic I won't call it optional. But how many parents know how to teach a young child themselves?"
"You're saying a whole lot of nothing:

>Whether you agree or disagree with the incumbent it’s a **bullcrap number.**

Ok, let's work with that premise. 

>I am renting and living above median standard of living and it’s **not even close** to that per month.

So higher or lower? The only 'useful' thing you've communicated is that it's NOT that number / close to it. Could be $0, could be $100,000. who knows.

>Second is **nobody** spends $3000 per month in Jakarta or KL, let alone a typical household earn **that much**.

Ok, so again, it's not $3000. Is it $0? Is it $100,000? who knows. 

That much? ok, suggests the number is too high. But again, the cost of living, vs what someone earns / can save for the long term, could be wildly different numbers. 

So once again, thank you for the insights. Apparently, according to you, it's NOT $10,000 in SG, and NOT $3,000 in KL."
"Apartment (1 bedroom) in City Centre	3,943.90S$

Apartment (1 bedroom) Outside of Centre	2,818.60S$

Apartment (3 bedrooms) in City Centre	7,778.95S$

Apartment (3 bedrooms)
Outside of Centre	4,870.83S$

I’ve been apartment hunting last month for last month and I got a condo for like $4k, but this is between city centre and what I would consider outside (Punggol, Tampines, etc.). “Average” around the area I’m hunting would be around 3 to lower 4k, anything above that is fancy condo. 

If this is “crowdsource” then by right this should be closer to average yet it is off by more than 20%. HDB if you are fine with an older unit, you’ll probably looking at 3-3.5k.

For the single bedroom is because most of units in Singapore tend to be at least 2-3br, for 1br apartment it would have to be a private which on its own would make it priced at a premium. I think when I was looking 2 years ago, it’s like $2k for studio, $2.6k for 1 br, so even with the recent spike it would still be higher than average"
"Are you married with kids? I can tell you iPhone is at most a annual expense. It's the kids' education and enrichment that are killers MONTHLY if you insist on upmarket choices. 

When my kids were young, a lot of my peers were implying there was something wrong with us for not packing my kids time with enrichment classes. One low EQ parent even told us that the ordinary childcare my son was enrolled in lacked academic rigor..."
Honestly 10k a month for spend isn’t even that high.

You don’t need a $10k salary to live in Sg , don’t be stupid."
"I don't really understand how the general audience won't understand that picture.

It explicitly states the cost of living in those cities for family of four.  
The numbers are obviously per month and in USD, unless you don't use your common sense.  
Source is provided as well, why need to add noise to explain who that source is? One can simply verify them.

The commenter was asking for EXTRA details, I simply pointed to the website."
"Are you trying to be obtuse, it’s lower, we are talking about just $6k-7k total spend a month.

> Who knows?

Average salary in Jakarta according to their singstat equivalent is just $500 SGD a month, and these are mostly tracking formal worker. Non-formal worker earns less and would bring the average down.

$500, assuming it is double income it’s merely $1000 per month. Many households are single income due to their majority conservative background."
"Do expats rent HDB? 

Maybe, you're not on expat package."
For sgHENRY yes. A lot in this sub are young singles drawing say 5k or less so they can't conceive of spending 10k in a HOUSEHOLD with 2 kids
"Only Singaporean knows about the most budgeted options because the cost of living here is indeed high hence we hunt high and low for budget example dining in hawker but our leaders have lost touch taking about food court and restaurants.

We Singaporean can only live the low live."
"You do know EIU cost of living etc is meant for foreigners not locals?

Foreigners with family wife 2 kids thse figures are around there"
"Comparison with durian is silly. This is not about preferences... its a failure of technique from whoever made this chart.


Nobody is saying the chart looks nice/don't look nice. The issue is nobody can understand the data.. back to the original question.. What do the number means? Is meant to be the cost of living for a family of 4 per month? Is it Weekly? Yearly? Quarterly? Do you yourself even know?


So I stand by it. It is a data visualisation fail because it has failed to show visually to the audience... what it's trying to show."
"So you are saying that its OBVIOUS to you that the average cost of living per month for a family of 4 in Singapore is 10k. USD somemore wor....  and that the GENERAL Audience will look at it and think..  ""yea.. sure.. looks right""..??"
"You could have simply quoted what you thought was a more accurate number and/or cited a reference - for a start. 

Instead. You go with ""that's rubbish (full stop). It's not that number (full stop)"". 

And then you call people obtuse. 🙄

Also, don't mix up cost of living with salaries. They may generally go hand in hand, but there's also feedback that COL is outpacing salaries. 

It's wild that you shoot down their number, by simply insisting that your number is more accurate (full stop). 

Shoot down their methodology (if it's published), or back up your number (or provide one to begin with even). But sheesh. ""That number is wrong (full stop)"" 🤷🏻‍♀️"
"Depends on what you would consider “expats”. If we are talking about literal meaning of expats, all FTs are expats. If we are talking about asian interpretation of expats, those are mostly angmoh expats and compared to “other” expats they usually earn more and therefore can afford condo and above. “Other” expats do live in HDBs."
"Actually, whether weekly, quarterly, monthly or annually don't matter?

The basis of comparison is the same for all the other countries.

The purpose of this infographic is to show which countries have higher cost of living. So, all we need to see is which bar is longer. The numbers don't really matter.

If they wanna do something more in-depth, they could put the median salary in the countries and then take these expense numbers to divide by those."
"The graph shows what the cost of living is for a family of 4 if they were to live the same lifestyle in all these countries.

The number for each country is meaningless on its own. The info is only useful in comparing against the other countries.

Thus, the length of the bars in relation to each other is more than enough to show this relation.

I think what you are trying to communicate is either the data source (Numbeo) is unreliable or that the basis of comparison (basket of goods they use) is unrealistic?

In that case, an earlier poster already shared that it is on Numbeo's website and just like anything we read on the internet or on the news, it is up to us to do our own due diligence and decide for ourselves if we want to trust the data.

That has nothing to do with how the data is presented, or do you expect a 28 page report or something as a footnote below every graph?"

Local girls are expensive
eh. we have long surpassed ang moh countries in cost of living liao. Go Europe and you'll find suddenly that the cost of your breakfast is cheaper than the equivalent in those stupid hipster cafes
Ang moh no gst voucher
"Because local cost of living is literally cheaper than Ang Moh cost of living.

Our income tax subsidised. Healthcare subsidised. Ni need exp rent because BTO cheap and affordable. Average AMDK diet is more exp cost more here than local food.

Our label of most expensive city in the world literally only applies to Ang Moh, not locals"

"Even just speaking to any local real Singaporean in the hawker centres will tell you everyone is badly affected by the non stop rise of inflation and prices. Malaysian and foreigners will pretend to claim it is not so bad because all their remitted currencies have high purchasing power in the safety of their home

Another conclusion we come to is since many of the ministers do not handle the cash transactions for their needs having assistants on public taxpayer expenses, they naturally feel nothing because even after all the expenses, they are still left with hefty amount of savings and CPF to add to our insult and injury. "
Inflation does not hurt PAP and their cronies one bit  but who continue to mercilessly increase the price of everything including fares of the monopoly of super normal profits of public transport companies.

Why you think they increase the GST?

"I fully agree with the GST part it was the wrong timing or completely wrong totally.


Foreigners bringing in their entire families or unrelated ones here is also an issue. 


But not the foreigners who are filling up most of the sectors which Singaporeans do not want to do. Or foreigners with the drive, skill and willingness to work hard here providing a productive workforce. A lot of them are like that rather than not.


Companies would naturally and more easily prefer Singaporeans if they can fill the same job. Things happen for a reason."

"Committee against profiteering formed by govt to monitor unethical price hike disguised behind gst hike. So far, I have Not come across any incidence of profiteering activity, or has anyone know of such cases happening."
They have clearly overspent to the tits during covid and have no choice but to raise gst. But they can't admit that openly because it would means that they had grossly mismanaged the covid situation with their reckless spending.
"Wow I didnt know that PAP could control global inflation.

Also wasn't SG one of the least affected by rise in costs? Lmao"
"voucher is once, or twice a year. GST is forever and every time you spend."
"Exactly. To him and his band of kakis, living in Singapore is very affordable. It's just too bad that the majority of peasants cannot afford it. 

The oppo keep hammering on GST.. That's wrong. What's wrong with the rich getting richer and the government making more money from the people? 

Get fucked people."
"GST saved the PAP efforts to impose it directly on consumers and citizens and the high taxes they impose on all imports ISD directly translated as higher prices at the supermarket and wet markets. That is why the GST is so addictive to them. Anytime they lose billions  on overseas investments, they simply increase the GST. "

"Singapore is just a place for them to work and stay, not a home which is most likely overseas. You can tell from their attitudes from the last 20 over years, there is no commitment nor actions to grow the Singapore core and develop the country further, just merely expanding on the current networks of infrastructure. "

Import taxes are on alcohol cigarettes cars 

GST is collected only if you consume."

After the GST offset, the profit is total is 70 dollars by the importer and the retailer.  

The 2 dollars and the 3.6 dollar GST that the importer and retailer respectively does not offset from the collected GST is lost profit 

It is does not make financial sense  for them not to offset the GST paid.

These companies  must already have the proper accounting system.  
Also for company income tax reporting purpose"

GST on your purchased price and the freight / shipping charges
what accounting system you talking about? they just increase price lah. what they will kanna? cheebye just say inflation then can magically increase price liao. got anyone go to jail for that? you ok or not? study too much is it?
Which everyone does what. It's kinda no secret as the prices increase is wayy more than 1%.
">In that case, it is the importer / retailer screwing the GST system

implement policy then fucking no one to enforce, what cheebye first world politicians we got"
"Enough to know how GST works instead of telling and spreading false / fake, whether unknowingly and worse intentionally spreading the false/fake misinformation 

Without GST, many CBs can also increase prices.   And don’t need magic to do that.   

Not only increase prices, some people also sell online and send you bad goods or don’t send you any goods"
At least better than the guy who paid 15% GST
Yes.  70 dollars is profit made by the importer and retailer.  The GST is 9% of 170 and not 15.3% of 170
"Renting is super affordable, e.g. Riddout Road $26,500 for 249,294sqft per month @ $0.106 psf.

Private condos and BTO launches are many times oversubscribed... What housing issues?
"Please let me know which developed country other than Japan is not facing housing affordability, rising cost of living and high levels of immigration.  At least housing in Japan is affordable if you're willing to live two hours away by commute."
"Singapore is also
Facing the same issues of immigration, expensive housing and too few good jobs for locals. 

Let’s hope our govt is listening and making to appropriate changes to address these issues"
"The issues in canada is actually quite similar to spore except not to the level of fuggery that is happening there but if we do not arrest it sooner to 1. slow immigration to a pace that integration can happen rather than overwhelming the locals, 2. arrest high cost of living / housing and 3. close the wealth gap, spore will surely experience the canada moment down the road"
Different context. Canada PM is being abandoned by his own party's supporters. SG PM is supported by his peers...
Blame PAP but no blame greedy singkie for taking the opportunity to rake in more profit it for their MOPed BTO
Yeah true ... Singapore messed up ita immigration policy too lah... that's why there is still a lot of discontent... except now in addition to CECA people now have to worry about cost of living crisis too
u smoking what..... the younger generation are already kinda affected by the bto scheme. U never wonder why within 5 yrs hdb resale went up?
"Transport woes will be worse.. Sg seems to have lopsided development in terms of residential - commercial buildings. 

Most of the population are commuting from areas like sengkang, punggol, amk, Woodlands, jurong etc, to places like raffles place and expo to work. Public transport already quite congested. Circle line cannot take anymore, no planning for expansion.

Feel like population increase will worsen current congestion, as the levels get more lopsided. More people residing at tengah, bidadari, etc. More commuting to town and back."
Yes because the idiots that got BTO flats went to flip their flats for even higher prices at resale
yea but is also partly because during covid everything was delayed or pushed back so some couples that didnt want to wait had to go to resale. Thats why demand went up and therefore prices?

">please help me reconcile your sky high salaries & your complaints on the increasing cost of living in sg.

Pro tip: the people with high salaries may not be the same people complaining and vice versa."
"IMHO, I am in my 40s and from my point of view. Yes, the cost of living has skyrocketed over the years. However it doesn't justify for some(not all) for the price hikes over time.  
If my favourite kopi goes from 70c to $2.50 then sure i don't mind paying more for it because I understand that rental and hiring for f&b has increased over time.  
However if I have to pay for some bland longkang heavily diluted tasteless kopi for $2.50 because of unjustified price hikes for kopitiam owners to make million dollars profit then no thanks.  
Enjoy life doesn't mean paying ridiculous prices for food or drinks to contribute to rising inflation and making the owners fat rich and constantly making profit, while consecutively opening sub-par food chains and outlets."
The people posting about increasing prices and then posting they earn 10k/m are diff people
"Need to talk in terms of real wages. If inflation goes like >20% but your wage increases <10% over the same span of time, ofc you would complain"
"1.50 to 1.80 is not a few cents leh. It's a 20% increase. $4 to $6 is 50%. So, suck it up just because you can afford it? And some stalls use 1% gst increase to justify 10% increase."
"The short answer for me is that these costs add up - You’re right that the absolute increases don’t seem like much. I used to pay $2.80 for a pack of eggs and now it’s $3.60. Two cartons of milk used to cost $3.50 and now it’s $3.95. 

It’s just that these small increases add up. I have many mouths to feed, and the overall impact of these increases are not insignificant. When inflation is 9 percent, my total monthly expenses goes up roughly that much (of course not exactly, but you get the idea). I don’t hiam these individual small increases but the total bill at the end of the month is really going up and it hurts because wages seldom rise as quick as prices.  I charge everything to my credit card bills for miles and it’s shocking how my monthly bill has gone up (I estimate about $1-1.5k more over the past 2 years)."
"Op needs to know this..

Earn higher wages doesn't mean we should pay more for stuff that doesn't justify the cost of it. If companies are not profiting from it is fine.

Just one recent example, a stall is charging 50 cents for taking away even when a customer brings their own container. Is 50 cents a lot of money? Nope. But would I complain about that and not support those greedy people? Yes."
"Wait till you have to buy your own place to live in, can’t qualify for govt subsidies, have a child(ren) and then you’ll realize how expensive things are"
"OP if you've just started working, I would hazard that you've been living under the generosity of your parents until now. If so, you won't fully understand the pains of cost of living increase, even with a higher salary, because the reality is you have yet to be personally affected by this issue.

Come back here three years in the future when you're self sufficient."
"Let's put it this way OP. Let's say you now earn 8k per month. And your fave kopi peng price went form 1.50 to 2.50 and your fave mall restaurant meal went from 25$ per meal to 35$ per meal. Then times this 30 days per month. How would you feel? 

Sometimes I think people lack empathy -- thinking those who they see as different don't share the same concerns. Like those earning higher income means money means less to them and they can just fritter it away. Higher income likely means they are older, have responsibilities at home (children and parents) and that means a lot more costs they have to shoulder. What makes you think these price increase doesn't affect them? Yes it affects them less than someone who is earning minimum wage -- but it affects them nonetheless.

We're all human. We are all trying to survive an uncertain future. No one wants to pay more than something is worth. And no one wants to be gouged by profiteers."
"It is just factually untrue that ""on average ppl here are easily earning above 5k/mth"". The median monthly income of Singaporeans is about 4.5k/mth ([https://dollarsandsense.sg/whats-median-salary-singapore-every-age-gender-education-race/](https://dollarsandsense.sg/whats-median-salary-singapore-every-age-gender-education-race/)). You only think people easily earn about 5k/mth because of selection bias, where higher earners tend to show-off while the average earner keeps quiet. 

For someone making 4.5k/mth, which after CPF deductions is only about 3.6k/mth take-home, the increase in F&B prices (which seems to be your main complaint) does in fact add up."
"My salary is high cause I develop my skill set to bring greater value.

A cup of kopi, 1.50 to 1.80 is still the same kopi. The kopi is not giving me extra caffeine or will help me lose weight.

That being said, I'm not against inflation. I think 2% yearly is fine. But 5% yearly is crazy."
"The small things add up. We can afford a one-time $0.50 increase in 1 meal, but if its 3 meals and day with 3 drinks, and twice-public transport a day, all these random $0.50 increases add up to a few dollars a day and a few hundred a month. For any median-income earner that will deflate their real earnings by 10-20%.

I think most of us on reddit will be able to accept a 3-5% inflation, but 20% inflation by businesses is just daylight robbery and we refuse to “suck it up”"
"Don’t think everyone is earning above 5k, only those who are earning higher salaries will be more willing to share. It’s called response bias.

For myself, I’m quite open about it but I earn 1.8k a month as a software engineer. Hence the price increments do affect me quite a bit. Still have to buy cigarettes and alcohol. It is a tough life and I know a lot of people will say I am a low SES person but I dont see anything wrong with instant noodles and am happy in life

Basically, for every person earning more than 5k there must be another earning below 5k. That’s why it’s called the median income"
"This is a troll question asked as nauseum for the purpose of up votes. It's already a fallacy to assume redditors are all high income earners or even trust in PAP Stats where median income is high or that means it's ok to tax, charge high on rentals and fees and make cost of living high as well for everyone in SG."
Why should the rich be willing to pay higher prices just because they are rich? Even if price increases may not be warranted?
"I complain about price increases even thought I make above median wage because I know there are others that don’t. It’s selfish to keep quiet just because you’re not suffering.

There are also different categories of goods. Necessities like bread, eggs, rice, basic groceries, hawker food, housing, public transport, should remain as affordable as possible because everyone needs them. Luxuries like Michelin restaurants, LV bags, condos, cars, you can jack up prices all you want: you won’t hear from me."
"Sounds like a Gen-Z living only for the moment ( nothing wrong though to live for the moment ). 

But at the same time, why can't people who live waaaaaay below their means complain about the high cost of living? 

Must all of us be abused before we have the credentials to talk against abuse? 

Must all of us be poor before we complain about higher cost of living?"
I can tell you our wages are definitely not keeping up with the sky high prices.
It’s not about $1.50 to $1.80. It’s the percentage of increase that’s getting serious. Sure we can all afford that 30 cents or 50 cent difference but if everything that surrounds you keep increasing  10 to 15% a year and then your salary only increases about 2 to 5% a year and there are some things that you cannot afford not to spend on like groceries and food.. Do you feel the pinch now?
"You think rich people got rich spending their money like you? Eating an Acai bowl to get through the week. 

They save, haggle, take every discount and freebie possible. At work, same mercenary attitude. Ask to cover colleague or OT? Geng abit act blur. 

That's how you climb up corporate ladder and do well.

Take that money go invest in Condo and more properties. 

Not the chinchye bro okok no problem. Team spirit ok. 

The problem isn't the quantum, it's about the value for money. 

Truth."
"Kopi and food prices are just a barometer for overall cost of living increases, which is the real problem for all folks."
"Depends on which demographic la. Median earners, after employees contribution and paying their mortgage, already have quite limited savings?

More broadly speaking, ppl have different relationships with money. It is good that you are flexible. But there will always be penny pinchers and misers around."
"The ones who have sky high salaries aren't the same ones complaining, just FYI

I know its tempting to just scroll through 2 different threads and think the people commenting on one is the same as the other, but it's not true"
"Different life stage. You're earning decent 4k a month and feeding yourself with no mortgage to pay no kids to raise. If you're earning decent have a mortgage to pay off and kids to feed, that 0.50 each time multiplied by the number of people adds up fast."
"Well not high paying for sure. But the problem for me is how expensive it is to raise a family. When we decided to have kids, we budget for it like any responsible parents. We budget for decent inflation based on our own experience. We budget for fun activities. What we didn’t expect is crazy inflation. So drinks from 1.20 to 2.50? That is like 120 per cent increase over a few years. Imagine when you multiple it by the dependents you have as a working adult? Totally ok if I am not responsible for my kids or my parents and only for myself. Then how about the need to budget for tuition now? It’s now almost a necessity"
Actually the complaint isn't just talk. Eg vote with your money. Do you support their rationale for price increase?  I'm not into reits so it's a non issue for me.
"You don't seem to pay for anything else other than for yourself. No housing loan or mortgage, no groceries, no utilities, and so on. Yes, your kopi peng goes up by $0.30, but that also means that everything else also has increased prices... not just your kopi peng and acai. It is very easy to survive and splurge with $4k a month if you are single and still living with your parents."
"There is a difference between adulting and being an adult. So many bills to pay, so many grocery and household items.

The worse is so little time. Weekends are gone in a flash.

I thought I was OK until I got my own place, I got mature overnight once I start paying for mortgage and other stuff."
"When we calculate how much it costs to FIRE, it's based on today's prices + CPI. However, if the actual price of items that we need to consume, i.e. food and utilities, is more than the expected CPI, we may find that we do not have enough to last our lifetime. CPI is based on a basket of goods and may not reflect the reality that people are experiencing.  

At 3% increment, it would about 22 years for the price to **double**. 

At 5% increment, it would take 22 years for the price to **triple**. 

Contrary to what you heard, cost of food in Singapore is lower than in Seoul. I lived there. Fresh food and cooked food are expensive. You can't buy lunch with SGD5."
"I'm ok with the increase in prices. but the kopitiam auntie deserves a majorbpay raise

I don't think that's happening"
"This is a pretty naive way to look at things. You need to compare price increase with your salary increase. Are you getting increments in line with inflation? If you aren't (which is true for most people), then the increase in cost of living will pinch. Your kopi increased by 20% and what if it increases by 20% again next year and you are still earning the same (or 5% more)? You would think it doesn't matter because it's a few cents but when all of it comes together and suddenly you are spending 20% more per month on the same salary, you'll start to realise its impacts."
"Often times cheap low quantum items like kopi and cai png are touted as these are considered everyday essentials and further illustrates frugality.

Using examples of price inflation in these items hence is a way to speak about larger issues as it cuts across all spectrum of society and earning powers.

Not complaining but if everyone don’t complain about worrying trends of disproportionate price inflation , merchants and businesses will just happily keep doing it for their own pockets"
"I have sky high salary, but also sky high cost of living."
"Micro transactions compounded is more expensive than your luxurious ones ie: air tickets, bags, tech stuff. An increase of daily cost is more detrimental as it affects your leisure costs. 
They are relative to each other

Daily cost UP=Leisure DOWN

Vice versa."
"After reading 20 odd comments, simple explanation is : Macro economics of demand and supply.

Demand is more because of purchasing power and it causes inflation. Since supply do not match demand prices / inflation is high. Vicious cycle of increasing income and inflation."
Not everyone earns $4k+ a month. There are still people struggling with inflation. So what sky high salaries are you talking about?
you sure its the same people commenting??? and also nobody enjoys paying higher price bruh. add the fact that complaining is our national sport then why is this surprising again?
"I think from their perspective ""expensive"" is can't afford SQ business, have to take economy or god forbid budget airlines 😂"
"I think as you meet more people in life and navigate a few more years in the workforce. You will realise one truth, and that is, everyone has a different relationship with money and different scale in measuring if a spending is worth it or just waste of money. Usually, you will realize this when you meet new friends / got a significant other who may not share the same world view about money and spending. To you, the acai bowl is worth it because it helps you though your week - then it is worth it because you see paying the 7-9 bucks for a week's happiness to be worth it. For other people, they may see this as money down the drain because it is just ice, sugar, calories and a few pieces of cut fruits. Both viewpoints are not wrong, just different way of seeing money and coming from different standpoints. 

So no need to scratch your head and wonder why people with certain salary complain about 50 cents increase in cai PNG. It's just different ways of seeing money and it's worth to people's life. You just need to focus on how you want to view and use money in a way that is in line with your life's values, no need to judge others."
"It’s because Singaporeans for some reason is unlike most Asian nationalities.  They are inherently frugal and in my opinion not very generous.  You can go to any poor country in SEA and the family no matter IT’s financial will welcome you with with whatever they have to offer.  I don’t see most Singaporeans have big hands like that.  Also SingaporeAns love to complain.

Hey I like to complain too and I’m not Singaporean!"
You just started at 4k. The salary can only go up. Most people here are already 10-20 years into their career. I start at 4k and am at 20k 10 years later.
"Its very simple, the sky high salaries are only for the top 10%, but increased cost of living will be felt by all."
"All this little items does add ups to your mthly expenditure.

&#x200B;

That starbucks coffee you have every other day, the salad, the grab. If nothing is change on your side, your expenses is gg to to increase by 10-20% overall aka to paycut.

Do not underestimate all this inflation, The key is to find higher salary, or other sources of income to offset it."
"Look, my mother in law has 2 properties, fully paid, is retired, no debt, and she complains how expensive things are getting in Singapore.

‘Wah chicken rice from $3 to $3.50! What is this?!’ 

I don’t understand why she complains but I know she wasn’t always rich nor born with a silver spoon."
"Watch people’s actions rather than listen to what they say. I look at COE, housing prices, waiting time for new tech launch like iPhones, queues outside popular restaurants. Can roughly see the demand is strong or not. 

That said, perhaps those earning above median salary are not complaining abt inflation."
Sorry. I don’t have sky high salary. Cannot help you. Do you have sky high salary?
"Half my salary goes to my studio apartment in the west, and I know I earn good money. It’s just that I had to re-sign my contract at the worst time in the post-COVID rent surge. And now I’m stuck with this for another year+."
"Because they are lying about one or the other. Either they lie about their salary, or they lie about their struggles. Either that, or they are conflating their own lifestyle inflation with actual inflation."
"I might be late to the party. But here's my two cents.

The people in sg is earning a median wage. at this time is appx 6k per statistics.

The increase per your example is coffee has increased 1.50 to 1.80 (20% increase). If we look behind operations, rental, raw materials, bills and manpower costs (which is all you employees out there) has all increased.  In absolute terms, we might be looking 10k-15k dollars cost increment. increasing coffee by 20 cents, they would need to sell 50k coffee to cover the costs. we can't say 20% is a huge increase, the base is low to start with.

The increase in cost of living does not justify why you should be paid more. It's what you contribute in productivity and then to the final revenue. Singapore already has one of the highest paid workforce and you can still get food for $4 avg.

If we really want to reconcile, we need the detailed breakdown of the spending. And tbh i am curious too that's why i am here."
"When comes to ownself huat, they say its only themselves. When comes to inflations and economic downturn, they say its everyone everywhere problems."
"Most complainants of high cost living are just ranting although realistically most get by with some financial discipline. The only ones I pay attention to are the low wage earners with family income less than $4k, with ongoing mortgage and  elderly sick. Without government subsidies and cash/cpf top ups, daily living can be on a tight string every month. Complain by all means but do check the boxes first. Be realistic."
"Yeah, buying crazy expensive properties and cars are okay, but when hawker raises prices by $0.30 - $0.50, it’s the end of the world.. 😂"
"You are right, folks who are genuinely wealthy don't complain about this. It's those who aren't that's making a big fuss, and I reckon a good portion are middle class average folks that are genuinely affected by inflation (which is working by intended design)"
"either some people are ‘kiam gu’ or they’re straight up lying about their salary. no one in my circle ever complains about a few cents inflation with everyday items. if you’re earning enough to be comfortable why stress yourself out over a few cents here and there? not like any of us can take our money to our grave. 

seems like singaporeans have difficulty just being content, doesn’t matter if someone makes 100k pa or 200k pa, if they are never going to be content with what they have they will complain about anything and everything"
"How much one earns doesn't change the fact that cost of living is sharply rising, or remove one's right to complain about it?"
"If we look at a bigger picture, it is not just an increase from 1.5 to 1.8 for a kopi or 4 to 6 dollar for a toast, it is 20% - 30% increase on everything. Not to mention rental and housing price has been increased to 40% last year. However, your salary do not increase that much unless you move jobs or have promotion. 

That’s being said, even though people are earning over 10k, their saving rates is now less than before."
"U just started working. Means u are not married, don't have kids or the need to support your parents. A typical not rich but try to act rich young adult. Don't worry, one day u will eventually be those kiasu adults when you reached parenthood."
Lol doesn’t have to look that far. There are some acquaintances that would go to JB every two weeks or so and spend a hundred or two at the very least in a day cause it’s cheaper there! Singapore math lol
"Dun need so far, pple say Jb massage 60rm, i go handynasty 60sgd, but i no need spend one whole day to get my massage… of course if u buy half of giant back or pump one full tank of petrol then i argue its ok…"
I dont understand whats bad about this math tho. Literally flight + few meals of sushi already makes up for price of omakase.

Need to escape reality by spending money bro
"Hahaha made me think of what I heard of the motor show this year, buy a car get a free Dyson vacuum, stupid. You spend low end 150k (Ref price of a BYD atto 3) and get a 700 vacuum. Seriously dumb. Which then in turn pushes COE up (jan 2nd bidding jumped 26k due to this). So in reality they got their vacuum for 25k 🤦‍♂️

Ok that’s not to say that COE jumped solely because of this, byd only entered the market in jan so this would have also impacted it, but the motor show has historically caused an increase
In COE price."
"Isn’t this more of the value you derive from it? Not saying everyone maxes out the value from their iphones but, there is alot of value to it and the prices have at least remained consistently expensive, i believe last 2 years the prices were the same? Someone correct me if I’m wrong.

On the other hand, some stalls have had this exploitive streak to raise it when theres a hike so its natural they suddenly become ‘enemies’ of the people. I understand their reasons too and tbf like you said, the hike isn’t too bad. Its just that it looks to be a much stronger trend of increment over the last few years at a faster pace."
"This is exactly why people are penny wise pound polish. They thought they very smart to ok with small increase with kopi price yet scoff spending 2k on an iPhone that improves their qol and save them time (compared to an android phone). 

The point I’m making here is that value is subjective."
"To be fair, I will always buy a flagship phone because I actually do a lot of out of hours work from my phone, mostly emails, supplier discussions via calls and chat, occasionally troubleshooting and escalation management. To me it’s a cost of my position."
"Unfortunately this is just capatalism. Nothing to do with Singapore. Companies are incentivised to cut costs by reducing quality as much as possible to the point of being just enough where they can still sell product and people don't complain. You see the trend of quality decreasing everywhere, from clothes to cars and tech devices."
"I watched malaysia mcd fillet o fish from Rm6 to RM17, this doesn't happen in Singapore.

I can price you so many other things. u only think it's cheaper because you are earning a stronger currency."
"I just wanna point out 1% gst increase is actually 1% per every supply chain step till it reach consumer. 
Hence 1% increase can actually lead to 10% increase. 
(I hate this as well)"
It's easier to explain than the cost of goods and salaries going up these past few years. Prices don't get updated very regularly at such price point.
Yes indeed. I estimate that my monthly expenses went up by 20-30% without any lifestyle inflation….
A regular grocery run that used to cost 60-70$ is now 100$. So prices going up do add up. 
"Ikr, to me I feel like I am just enabling or encouraging this behaviour if I were to take part in buying the stuff with extra costs. In the long run it would not be surprising to see $15 min hawker stall food, might as well go eat in a cafe with similar prices."
">Come back here three years in the future when you're self sufficient.

Odds are low that OP will have moved out, given the BTO wait time is 4-5 years, and 35 is the youngest you can buy flat as single."
"Agreed. It’s uncertainty and having no visibility about the future (eg retrenchment, loss of business, decreased income) that makes any rise in costs, regardless of the jump in price / item purchased, very uncomfortable. Since costs often only go up, rarely down."
">And your fave kopi peng price went form 1.50 to 2.50 and your fave mall restaurant meal went from 25$ per meal to 35$ per meal.

Which kopi Peng stall increased price by $1?"
"Am I blind or does the article you linked say the median income 5k?

"not totally true, your salary is also high because cost of living is high, salary is typically benchmarked to COL"
How is that salary possible as a SWE?
"dont jack up car price leh, i still wan to buy car in the future after my studies😅"
Actually a lot more people pack food in my office. I don’t buy coffee at the Kopitiam these days - I keep a bottle of Nescafe and some tea bags in office. It didn’t make sense when my kopi o kosong went from 90cents to $1.50. Etc.  some things I will still splurge on but the norm shifted from buying outside cafe / kopitiam food to meal prepping and only eating out less than half the time. The price increase compared to even 2 years ago is significant for everything from kopi and rice with veg to the eggs and mushrooms in ntuc. It really adds up.
Currency strength is just one factor. Sure it makes imports more expensive but also make exports more attractive. You should look at consumer price inflation in local currency. Malaysia has actually controlled inflation quite well
"Actually no, GST for GST companies can be reimbursed. So the tax has minimal trickle down impact and should only affect end consumers."
You should read more about how GST works.
"Only if the supplier use the same lame reason to justify. Notwithstanding how gst works, even if your costs increase 1%, you dont need to increase 10% revenue to maintain the same profit margin lol."
"I agree it's easier to explain and understand the actual rationale for price increase but I feel like stallholders are just taking us for a fool when they give a lame excuse. It's like ""my dog ate my homework"""
"I really don't understand why many are just pointing fingers at the business owners when I see a number of bz owners in the service line struggling with rental hikes. If the business owners are so brainless and anyhow charge, they know they can't sustain long term and would have already gone bust.

Pardon my sarcasm, if u r feeling upset over a few bucks and yes I know everything adds up over time, just take it as u have donated to charity and never patronise that stall/shop again."
It's 5k only if you include employer CPF. But most people can't access that for everyday living expenses. 
">salary is typically benchmarked to COL

Tell that to 7-11, last I checked the salary for counter staff is $1,579 monthly. I don't think that's benchmarked to cost of living in Singapore."
"of cuz its not 100% true.

but u think ur salary will rise faster tru taking on more responsibility / promotion, or it will rise faster due to the meagre yearly salary increment to account for inflation?

some companies don't give increment, some just give token sum like $50-$100 (regardless of your base amount)."
"You obviously have no idea about me. I just brought my third car (not owning all at once)

Yea you can buy a car at a fixed cost, you can also bid on COE yourself and bring your own to some dealers (Tesla for example).

Do you think dealers are gracious enough to absorb a 26k COE increase? Yes they build in some buffer, but this is around a 30% increase on the previous month, car prices will rise to make up their lost profits in the short term."
"yeda was the one complaining about the iPhone. Ask him.

 My point is that he is underestimating the mid-term impact of the cost of a $2 coffee, and why people should not be complaining about it.

And also that is not the way to use penny wise, pound foolish. But as you can see, there are many green-eye monsters hating people who choose to buy the iPhone."
"Only for gst registered companies (above 1m revenue or voluntary). Small players usually don’t register due to higher accounting overheads. 

So yeah, GST does impact downstream."
"> where you could save at least 1k on a lower-end phone without blowing it on the latest and most shining gadgets. 

Like you said lor, most people will rationalise their purchases. It is a very small minority that will choose to buy the iPhone Pro Max. Most will pick a more reasonable compromise _and_ still struggle with those $0.20 or $0.50 price hikes.

Yeda just chose an easy target, and everyone seems to like to lynch the strawman too."
"You need to license your cats in Singapore soon :) 

I think if you rent out your four bedder and keep maintenence low enough you can get by, public health here should be significantly more affordabl, more so long term. Same with food utilities etc,

"4K USD is very comfortable to live in Singapore since your house is fully paid for. Not sure what company stocks you own, but I would slowly transition to SGX stocks as there is no taxes on dividends and capital gains, but the growth usually not so good. Local bank stocks are giving about 6 to 7% dividends annually. 

I don’t see why you need to top up CPF since you have housing covered, and a steady recurring income from dividends should cover your retirement needs. Biggest issue on hand is your medical condition, and getting proper insurance coverage, although I don’t see how it can be worse in US than here. 

How much is the condo maintenance? 4bed should be around 400+ unless it’s a boutique development. I don’t think you should consider downgrading because of maintenance fees, it’s not going to be huge savings."
"I would consider renting out the 4bd condo and rent a smaller condo unit. 
No reason to sell the 4 bd condo now seeing that you are relatively ok in the cash flow department."
"Sell the condo , downgrade the house to a 2 room hdb , find the easiest relaxed kind of pt job , pay 0 tax as income p.a is less thn 21k and receiving all the gov benefits .

Need not worry out whether the condo can rent out or not and also unsure whether tenants u rent out to will be a hell for u . 

And by doing this , u can ample amount of time to relax and do what u will like to do as bills and maintenance will be low and the downgrade profit u can put some in mmf , fixed deposit ,top up cpf sa and also doing pt u can just occupy your time in a very relax way .

Boss scold u ,u jus quit no big deals anyway"
"You can live very well on 4k USD a month if housing is covered, like way better than the simple life you described where BBT and video games are your “vices”.

Did you get a green card? That adds tax complications. 

If your dividend stocks are US stocks, that also adds complications because if you are no longer paying US taxes, then as a Singapore tax resident, Uncle Sam automatically takes away 30% of each US-derived dividend. 

Plenty of options on what to do with your big old condo. That’s a second order decision.

Figure out the tax stuff and the medical stuff first. If your medication is an antibody or other expensive type, your expensive but comprehensive US health insurance becomes very worth it. If you don’t already have private hospitalisation insurance in Singapore (ISP) on top of compulsory Medishield, your autoimmune diagnosis will likely cause you to be rejected from any new insurance application or the condition will be excluded from coverage. And anyway outpatient medications are not covered. So it’s really important to find out if your medication is approved and subsidised in Singapore. And if this medication stops being effective, are the second and third line treatments available and subsidised."
"I am not a financial planning expert but in medical field and also deal with autoimmune disease. My experience is that certain medical fees can really deplete you more than usual daily cost of living. I think you should really understand what kind of treatment you need and if it's well cover by your insurance in America. Get it into remission ideally while in US if you need complex biological treatment that is not available in Sg. But if its not treatable by biological,  do consider if you are over charged in US , compare to what you may be expected to pay in sg govt restructured hospital. Not everyone can also afford Sg private care with chronic and very complex illness if they have a fat financial cushioning. It is not uncommon for many to get wring dry by private healthcade in Sg, and have to 'downgrade' to government restructured medical service. If in USA, try to check that you are getting the proper standard of care, rather than private medical just trying to wring more from your insurance.
You are also very young, it's essential to ensure that you get your disease in remission /good control to minimise long term damage and recurrent problems needing again repeat intervention cost.
You might be happy to live simply wherever you are but if not in remission, you may not be cost saving in the long run."
"Sorry to hear about the negative effects that your work has on your health. Work is costing you your health. You can afford to stop working. You can't afford to pay (in health) to keep the job. You may even fully recover your health when you leave the job. You may want to read the first few chapters of the book ""Your money or your life"" by Vicki Robin if you feel the need for some extra validation for your decision."
"You should have more than enough to live on.

You didn't mention whether you have a green card, but you may want to speak to a tax consultant prior to moving back. This is to understand whether you have an ongoing US tax reporting obligations and how any withholding tax is going to be levied on your US sourced income once you become Singapore tax resident. 

If you choose to rent out your condo and stay elsewhere, you need to find a pet friendly place. Not all landlords are open to that."
"Usd4k is above the median income already. And when/if you downgrade, you'd have free accommodation plus extra cash. You're going to be living a better life than most Singaporeans without working, and hopefully that removes the stress and thus the costs in healthcare."
"I have no advice on the finance part but as a fellow rare autoimmune condition patient, the medical cost in sg can get quite rough. Even if you only need med during flare, you probably need to see a rheumatologist regularly to ensure your condition is under control. Going private can get very costly, so you may want to consider seeing as a subsidised patient. I also agree that high stress can worsen autoimmune condition as I felt much better after switching to part time work."
"Full disclosure: I am a fee-based financial advisor serving HNW clients. The following are general insights, not personalized advice.

USD 4,000 (\~SGD 5,300) monthly in dividends alone can certainly support a comfortable lifestyle in Singapore, especially given your inherited condo eliminates housing costs (typically the largest expense). Your situation is actually quite favorable for leaving the workforce, though a part-time role would add both income security and social structure.

Looking at your financial picture: Your investable assets total approximately USD 850k (700k RSUs + 150k 401k) plus SGD 120k CPF, which translates to roughly SGD 1.3 million excluding your property. The 4% withdrawal rule would suggest sustainable annual withdrawals around SGD 52,000 (\~SGD 4,300 monthly), which aligns closely with your current dividend income. For comparison, Singapore's median household income is about SGD 9,000, but that typically covers multiple people and housing costs.

Regarding your specific questions:

1. For your 401(k), strongly consider transferring it to a Traditional IRA and leaving it invested in the US rather than withdrawing. Early withdrawal penalties plus taxes could cost 30-40% of your balance. The US-Singapore tax treaty allows for favorable treatment of these withdrawals during retirement.
2. Your RSU concentration represents significant single-company risk. Consider gradually diversifying into a global portfolio while being mindful of tax implications of selling.
3. CPF top-ups are worth considering for the tax benefits if you take on part-time work in Singapore, but may not be your highest priority given your asset base.

The conventional advice for returning Singaporeans is to immediately rebuild retirement accounts and secure full-time employment. However, your financial position is stronger than most. The key consideration isn't just whether you can afford to stop working, but creating a sustainable withdrawal strategy that accounts for inflation, healthcare costs (especially with your condition), and the psychological aspects of early retirement.

Your condo maintenance fees warrant analysis as if they exceed SGD 1,000 monthly, downsizing to a newer, smaller unit might improve your cash flow and reduce future maintenance headaches, though transaction costs are significant. A part-time job offering 20-25 hours weekly could provide SGD 2,000-3,000 monthly while significantly reducing stress compared to corporate America, giving you both mental stimulation and additional financial buffer."
"Stay at the inherited condo. and Rent out two rooms to two tenants. You can get 2000-3000 extra a month depending on location. U save money renting another unit, and yet can monitor the tenants behaviour daily."
"Sell 4 bedder condo and change to dual key, rent out one side and live on the other. (Prefer high floor good location)

Put your savings into a few of the big banks in Singapore offering high dividends (6-7% as other redditors suggested) and with the rental income plus this, I am willing to bet you can live quite luxuriously (daily takeout, car ownership type of life)

Do buy good insurance to ensure stuff are covered (high plan?) 

Best of luck on your adventures and get well soon!"
To be honest why dun u just rent out 1 to 2rooms while u live with ur cats..at least anything happen got ppl know
"Since you already have a place and some savings and passive income, definitely able to afford to stop working. Main bulk of cost of living in SG is mortgage and medical. If you are healthy then the passive income will allow you to even save up more money in SG.

The problem though is medical, not sure if you have a green card in US, if you have a green card then US medical maybe cheaper than SG. Medical bills are subsidized for Singaporeans but even after subsidy it can still be very expensive, things can go up to 5 or even 6 digits. If anything happens to you, and it maybe hard for you to buy insurance since you have a medical history so you need to keep aside a bigger amount of savings for emergencies. The good thing about SG is there are places you can seek help from if you have no income, but likely you will need someone to help you to apply and stuff if something were to happen to you.

As for CPF i think you can wait until you're back, enjoy a bit of life before deciding whether to CPF top up, once the money goes in you can't take it out. 

As for the 4 bedder, what kind of condo is it, is it a boutique project or big development, how much sinking fund does it have ? If sinking fund is low, sometime after you stay in you maybe asked to top up the sinking fund which may be up to a 5 digit sum. 

I won't suggest to rent it out then rent another place because rental is a pain, when you rent the place out the tenant won't take care of the unit, there will be a lot of loose ends, every time you rent it out and take back you need to check the place and touch up for new tenant, sometimes things in the house spoil and there will be conflicts and arguments between you and the tenant, a lot depends on luck on what kind of tenant will you be getting, for a 4 bedder likely you will be getting a huge family, meaning a lot more things to look at. 

When you rent the place out, its also income tax-able, but since you are not planning to do a full time job you might not even be taxed for it, but its just the hassle and stress, your reason for moving back is to live a less stressful life, might as well sell your place and buy another place. 

Will suggest either you : 

* Try to buy a HDB, e.g sell your condo, rent a place, wait 15 months then buy a HDB, or appeal to HDB to waive the 15months wait
* Sell your 4 bedder condo and look for a smaller unit, 2 bedder or 3 bedder \~ likely your 4 bedder is old and need to touch up the place, so might as well just sell and look for smaller units, right now the market is in demand for big size units so its easy to sell, there are a lot more 2 bedrooms in SG so its easier to buy a smaller unit
* Consider renovating your 4 bedder into a dual key unit (subjected to management approval), recently there are a lot of IDs doing this, so you can do like a 2 or 3 bedroom unit and the other side a 1 or 2 bedder so you can enjoy privacy while earning more passive income, you have to spend quite a bit to renovate though"
"• Sustainability of Retirement

If you do up your expected steady expenses after experiencing life back in SG for a few months, that should give you a clearer idea how long and how probable your financial assets can sustain your early retirement.

• Impact to Current Dividends?
Is your dividend generating portfolio (assumed to be primarily US equities) currently taxed at a resident alien rate? Once you have relocated, the taxation will jump to 30%.

If it is not primarily US equities, the stability of that dividend payout can be ceteris paribus estimated.

• Vested RSUs

Although you would be familiar with the trajectory of the underlying business as an employee, the RSUs probably form a large proportion of your financial assets. Purely from a positioning POV and that your currency with near-term developments and trajectory of the company will drop, perhaps you may want to encashing a portion of it to switch to other income generating and income growth financial assets while still remaining vested in a business that you probably got in at a good price. The idea is to start reinforcing your cashflow generation to deal with future medical costs.

• Property

An old 4 bedroom condo would be huge. As there is no information on its tenure and whether there is enbloc potential, it could be any option proposed by the people here. How about using a rough tool by Edgeprop to gauge its enbloc potential?

https://www.edgeprop.sg/en-bloc-calculator

In today's market, an old 4 br condo will be making good profits. Downgrading will allow you to move to a smaller place for easier maintenance and assuage any lease decay concerns (if current place is leasehold) and unlock value which will allow you to create a Health Fund to ringfence money for your future medical expenses as your disorder will probably make you uninsurable."
Don’t sell your 4Br condo unless you really need the cash. It will likely appreciate and you can rent it out
"If you don’t foresee yourself going back to work in the US, give up your green card so you won’t have to pay US taxes anymore. Once you have that, there’s a form to fill up to prove you are a foreign resident and then there’s no tax withholding on your US stocks. 

4k a month is comfortable. Rent a smaller place and rent out your condo. 

I also hope to move back from US one day. Good luck with your move."
"USA is probably safer, idk what you mean by volatile but the healthcare cost is criminal. Sg still
Expensive"
"I think $4k is v comfortable in sg. Most of us live on less than half of 4k (no kids) with pets. You’re v young still , you can look up LinkedIn for jobs but actually you should just move back first, then plan what you want to do.

What u read about how expensive sg is, I feel is exaggerated. It’s much more ex to live in certain cities in US. Rent for instance is much higher in US than in sg in major cities. And some American influencers go around on social media saying how ex sg is. BS lah. They’re just trying to get attention. 

If you want to downgrade to a Hdb or a smaller condo, buy insurance, etc, you can do that later on. 

401K, you can search on Reddit what others do….
penalty is 10%… 

When you’re back in sg yr ‘luxury’ will change 🤣
And you’ll b much more relaxed.
I worked in US before too so I know how it is.
Just try to take it easy and come back first. 

When I came home I basically just packed, threw things and took d plane back, then plan what I wanna do. Sg is far less complicated, predictable and stable; very easy place to live in. This is what many locals don’t fully realise and many expats appreciate about sg. In the US, an ER visit cost me $2000usd for nothing 🤣"
"Nice... sure u can. Sell the 4bedder and rent. Wait 15 mths and then buy a hdb. Take gd care of the cats... vet bills are extremely high

Buy btc etf, thats all"
"$1000 can buy HDB, everything is very affordable"
"I actually feel like you shouldnt sell your condo if its a relatively new condo (less than 15 years). I think condo in Singapore has a lot of room for growth in the next 5-10 years.

What I would do:

\+ Rent out condo at S$5000+. Net rental cash flow after maintenance / repair / Misc = S$4000. 

\+ Rent a 2-3 room HDB at S$2500. Net cashflow (condo - hdb) - S$1500.

\+ Coupled that with the US$4000 in dividend, I think its more than enough, with some to spare to reinvest into the index.

With a dividend portfolio of US$4000, and your RSU of US$700000, if there are no additional expenses, I think its more than enough to retire. :)"
"4K USD monthly and if you rent out your 4 bedder the co-living way can possibly net you another net SGD 4K per month so that's a good SGD 10K roughly 

Assuming you live with family or arbitrage by renting in JB and traveling around wherever. 

Single me can definitely live on SGD 10K per month but you will also need to consider taking a chunk of that to reinvest in more cash paying stuff such as dividend stock to counter long term inflation.

Cost of living in SG has gone up but it's much more about personal preferences (if you're not the sort to spend much, you have a lot of surplus). Other stuff to consider is medical insurance which can be sizable."
Rent out 3 bedrooms to fellow expats/friends..in built social circle and profit from it
"Oh yeah, thanks for the info! I’m prepping to bring back my cats now and it is quite a process. Just got their vaccines updated and have to wait 3 months+

I’m hesitant to rent out the condo, I had bad experiences renting it out previously 🤣"
"I hold the usual popular stocks like TSLA, NVDA, MSFT, RTX, PFE, VRNA, KO, WMT, LMT etc. and some ETFs. 

Yes, I’ll be looking into insurance coverage. My brother referred me to his insurance agent. 

Yeah, condo maintenance fees aren’t too bad. I’m also concerned that since the unit is rather old and large (2200+ sqft), I’d need to spend a significant amount to update and maintain it."
highly agree! renting out will def cause u stress so i suggest u dont
"I’m not an expert, I just follow what others recommend. I hold SCHD, VOO, JEPQ, QQQ, O, SVOL, PNNT. SVOL is high risk so not something I would recommend. I got a bit lucky with crypto in the earlier years (I was obsessed with cryptokitties). I took part of what I profited from crypto and put into ETFs and stocks. I work in big tech too so my salary is decent and set aside a portion every month to savings and investing."
"I am pretty sure it's more than the volitate situation in US, I heard the cost of living there is high even though you earn more and the quality of living is low."
"u will be fine, 37 still considered young. Stay positive yeah. 4k usd dividends income monthly is decent enough, like average median income I guess. Rental is stressful perhaps you can outsource to get someone to manage for you? take away the stressful part of managing the tenants."
"Nope I wasn’t there for so long. Just 2 years and I m not a typical shopaholic Singaporean I think 🤣
Most Singaporeans wherever they go, they buy so much. I only owned 2 winter jackets and usually wear only 1 h&m one that was so cheap but really good quality. 

I did have a no of books. I didn’t even buy much furniture. I love how simple my apartment was. I hated living In the US 🤣 coz it’s super racist and discriminatory and I was in a state where it’s rough for foreigners and Asians. But I appreciated the experience and I’m grateful that I was given the opportunity to work there. 

It’s funny people here complain about costs of living. It’s worse in the US.
And some more you have to look over yr shoulder every where u go. 

Anyway, you’ll have a great resume and companies will hire u readily: take a break and then maybe look for a job. Don’t worry. If you’re Singaporean, you will never be destitute if you’re willing to work. Those people who complain and complain, got food to eat, Hdb to live in, still complain so much…"
"I came back with 2 x 21” luggages and 1 carryon haha… what they have, we also have 🤣I didn’t feel like I have to buy them when I was there.

but u do u… u were there for a longer time. 

The things I missed most about USA are : the challenges as a non American (I love it that I’m pushed out of my comfort zone), the freedom to express myself (no bro it’s different in USA and France), the nature and place I can visit, the fresh produce (I miss the curly kale, fresh fruits, berries).
But I don’t really like Whole Foods; it’s super expensive. You can easily spend $500 on a single trip if you’re not careful. So I don’t really shop there 🤣"
"Furthermore, rent is on par with big cities in America, wages lower.  If you don’t have a car in sg obviously avoiding massive expense so I think it can go either way. Posh nyc / California life of course more expensive than sg. But sg col higher than many a city in America
Just being a realist"
"Ohh lol nice! I don’t like shopping either, I don’t even have a TV 🤣 but I have a few pieces of artwork I wish to bring back. For jackets and tees, I just wear my company swag or the free stuff from hackathons/conventions lol 

I live in an area with a high % of immigrants, most of my neighbors are Chinese from China. There’s 3-4 hotpot places within walking distance, sometimes I can smell the hotpot broth in the air lmao 

Yeah it’s expensive here! A meal is almost $20 on average and more if you tip. 

Many Singaporeans take safety for granted. I got my car broken into twice and I parked in a secure garage. I don’t go out alone at night. I carry pepper spray on me and have a light weight bulletproof insert in my backpack."
"This is something I have realised living in the west for few years.

Singapore definitely seems expensive and also is, but Singapore has a lot of scope of cutting down expenses.

For someone who is a local, hdb and public schooling prevent them a cheaper way out for most big expenses compared to foreigners.

My time outside I realised that generally no subsidies are provided by the government and even if you are earning well, expenses are equivalent to Singapore and you will realise that your purchasing power is so less because of high taxes. Another key expense is food where hawker centre are god send.

In a nutshell, if you are okay with Singapore style living, no other country(expect US for tech and finance) can give you a better purchasing power."
"Went to the US earlier this year

Things are way more expensive than SG / HK / Europe

Makes me feel appreciative of <$10 meals that are still widely available in SG"
"United States like to play the “additional fees”. You can sign up $8 for a mobile plan here and it is really $8 nett. US, you have to pay federal, state and operational taxes fees on top of the gross price. "
"While it’s true Singapore IS expensive, people often don’t realise it’s relatively cheap compared to other developed nations.

I’d say our CPF+HDB scheme helps a lot in making housing a reality for majority. Our hawker food is also really cheap; not many developed countries can match this. And our income tax is extremely low, with no capital gains tax to boot!

If we’re being honest, Singapore is indeed not expensive, relatively speaking."
"It's totally relative. If you're making the median monthly income of $5200 and have to rent a studio apartment on the market for easily $2500, that's 50% of your gross income.

Comparatively, the median income in San francisco is $100k, with average studios going for $2,200. That's 26% of gross income. (of course ignoring taxes, CPF etc).

It is not as expensive if you have the (luxury of) choice of buying HDB, staying with your parents etc. 

Singapore is very cheap if you fit the mold. Straight, married, stay HDB, take public transport, uni grad, parents paid for uni + stay with parents till you get your own house..... 

It's very expensive if you don't have that choice"
How dare you say that Singapore has lower cost of living!!! Oh wait this isn't asksingapore...
I just got a good reminder of that after spending 10 days in Oz!
"Taxation is the biggest factor to account for the higher up you go in the income bracket.  Cost of living becomes progressively less important the more you earn, while taxation becomes more and more of a factor in hindering capital accumulation.  

This is really the main reason why the US and Europe tend to attract 'immigrants', while Singapore attracts 'expats'."
"> In a nutshell, if you are okay with Singapore style living, no other country(expect US for tech and finance) can give you a better purchasing power.

Exactly, if you live in HDB, don't drive a car, eat local food and use public schools and healthcare, you'll have a very low cost of living compared to similar developed countries and cities.

Of course if you try to live like an American with three cars, a detached landed house and beef at every meal (LOL), budget gets out of this world."
"I agree . With Singapore policy of influx of high value new citizens, properties and rental are all speculated to all time high . The middle and poor class have to bear the high cost of the land scarce Singapore . For other countries , if the Central Area are too costly , they can travel more outskirts to reduce cost . Being a city state Singapore there is nowhere."
"It's not about living the Singapore life, it's more of a problem for people who wants a very western life. Condo + Club membership + Car. With two people working, you can afford renting a condo and still save, but if someone wants 1300 sq ft condo because they don't like smaller places, then definitely Singapore will feel expensive."
"Wah I strongly disagree with Hong Kong. The food isn't cheap. And service is so bad. There is always a competition for space too. 

The entire city is cluttered, congested and crowded.

Rentals are high for a very small space. Food is not as cheap as Singapore. 

Sure the salary in Hong Kong is higher, but the quality of life there is definitely lower than SG.

Meanwhile for Switzerland, I've only heard about the high costs of living. Never once I hear ppl say it's cheap or affordable."
"Wow you got a ton of downvotes without anyone saying anything. Since the linked post was about cost of living in the US, there is 0 particular benefit to being local and a citizen in the US beyond the right to vote (albeit with global taxation on your income).. To the extent that there are any benefits like tax 401k and social security, you are eligible for it as a non citizen as long as you have paid into them. Whatever tax rebate scheme exists, it applies to all, and I would imagine is alr factored into the cost of living study above.

Basically, Singapore is a bit of an abberation in terms of how our government does things for locals.. such as the frequency it doles out cash rebates and offsets if you are a citizen or if you have served NS, or the entire hdb ownership scheme...

Edit: or Healthcare subsidies.."
"It's not just about home country as when we are comparing we are not assuming that you will live with your parents. 

  
I do agree home country has some advantages. I am on an EP. Pretax salaries in Singapore is at par with a lot of other countries and due to low tax you have a much wider in-hand salaries.  So even if you will add private schooling and condo life with maid, you might save more than other countries especially Europe and Canada. Day care costs a bomb in these countries.

The above statement won't be true for everyone especially if you have multiple kids as each month education can cost 4k per kid. Cars are luxury in Singapore, so adding that as a cost because someone wants a similar life to a car centric country won't make sense."
"If you think giving out money can solve the high cost of living issue , then you are not far sighted . Money payout is temporary, the inflation and increase of tax is permanent. Ppl complaining about high property prices which were inflated by the lack of supply not by norm inflation. Does it make sense for a public housing HDB 4 room flat to sell at 1 mil or more? Of course good for the seller , but after the resale , the new launch BTO around the area will price accordingly to the resale pricing . Now new BTO pricing will be at $500k-750k . How my children can afford these pricing in the future ."
"You guys are funny. Asking for government for help, yet unhappy with inflation. Come on is 101 basic economics if giving out free money is not going to reduce inflation and prices won’t come down. 

Is populist politics and always works.
No government wants harder way out, but only kicking cans down the road."
"HK: Mhhh income taxes are +5% for me in SG (and can offset HK rent from taxes). No VAT in HK. Have cheap options like Cha chaan Teng for food, then similar prices for fancier restaurants in both countries. Definitely higher salary in HK. In both scenarios my rent was comparable for HK and SG condos (SG getting very expensive for expats post Covid). 

CH: I’m talking about the purchasing power. Yes life is expensive, but a Swiss salary is way above what we see in HK or SG. Switzerland always ranks top in terms of purchasing power.

PS: I lived and worked in SG/HK/CH for over 5 years each."
"It’s also depending on individual expectations in life , if you looking to have less stressful life , retire early , loves to drive around , love big open spaces and less costly place to bring up children , then I dun think Singapore is right for u . Singapore is a costly place where life is very competitive, with long working hours , and cost a bomb to bring up a child . The government encourage and expect you to work till your 60s. Car and sizeable house is not a necessity but a dream for most singaporean . Most living in shoe box size homes which I do not think westerns will chose for their homes . If you think living in Singapore is cheaper , the only things I can think of is it’s food cost and healthcare ."
"Agree, plus the grab rides are pretty pricey especially clashes with SG holidays - got a shock from a recent trip"
lol Singapore is indeed costly . Wonder how it got the title “the most expensive city in Asia “
"Always work? Nope.

The current administration gave out large amounts of $ during covid, yet didn’t get re-elected."
"I am not complaining free money. I prefer hard way,  why giving free money when inflation is high and increase gst tax? Both policies direct affect inflation. I remember back then yr 2022 1 day be4 government announce budget same fish soup stall selling 5.5$ and next following day increase by 50 cents. Is that coincidence? I don’t think so.

If housing price is high why not regulate further, instead of cooling measures and continuing monitor market? Is common sense that government prefer price continue go up than down  because majority voter will be unhappy. Just look at South Korea and Canada. 

2018 - calling China housing bubble
2021 - South Korea housing bubble 
2023 - calling sg and Canada housing bubble

Let’s see who is bag holders."
"I used to work in Germany and France. For a family with kids, I find Europe cheaper than SG. For a single Europe is expensive. 

Eating out and luxury items in Europe is expensive. 

My big downside of living in Europe is Helper is expensive."

"Taxing consumption to redistribute to the lower income is this govt's explicit way of closing the inequality gap... with the numerous cash and tax offsets for the lower income an explicit design to offset inflation for the lower income so they come off net equal or better.

Inflationary pressures are global, but locally, more so than the gst, things like the progressive wage model which is increasingly being broadened exert inflationary pressure to costs of goods and services. At the end of the day the govt is trying to raise incomes and financial security for the bottom segment of society including those who work gig jobs and at hawker stores.. so inevitably food prices will rise (and even then it's still much cheaper than the US and it barely helps the avg hawker close the gap to a 200k-700k earning SG Henry).

Anyway all of these are explained by the minister of finance over and over."
"My advice is only move to HK or Shenzhen if it makes sense financially. You won’t enjoy the experience if you have to watch your spending too closely.
I always benchmarked costs of living, negotiated the salary (it brings many benefits to the company to bring an expat, and involves sacrifices from the expat to move to a foreign country), and said no when it did not make sense.

Fully agree that you will get a lot of cultural and professional experience. I feel blessed 😁."
"Singapore inflation 2023 4.8% , malaysia 2.5% , Japan 3.2% , Taiwan 2.5% HK 2.2% . it’s not becos of global inflation , it’s our government mas policy to raise GST during hard times of high inflation of food , groceries, rental prices .other countries like Malaysia , Brunei, etc give our subsidies to cushion out these hard times , our Singapore government increase taxes . Increasing 2x , 1% yearly , which give the merchants to raise prices 2x which most increase more than 2% .Food prices averagely raise more than 6-7% . Property prices in Singapore are speculated by due to the lack of supply during COVID, along with several ineffective cooling measures which were criticised by many , continue to raise till today . If you ask me , I feel that the government didn’t do a good job for these few years ."
"Agree, but some people sadly don't think or see the picture rather just from their own selfish perspective. Also EU have a much higher gst than sg atm."
lol  did I mention fed? I didn’t I am saying current administration. Pls read.
"Don’t need explain to singaporefi ppl here, majority here only pro VWRA with no knowledge economics and yet copy paste what government says. Dumpster

I already unfollowed singaporefi. Is not going benefit me anyway lol

Overall what I trying say is lower income people still suffer in silence. CDC vouchers and gst voucher not going to help much."
"Hello fellow FIRE SGrean! I too FIREd three years ago, even when I was only about \~80% of my goal - but life couldn't wait, money is just money, and so I decided to stop work and also, leave Singapore. I was 36 then, 39 now. I'm single, so it weighs easier on me expenses wise.

I've been traveling since - working on farms, bought a campervan, experienced different cultures across Asia (Japan, Taiwan, Malaysia etc). I saw so many different ways of living and it really opened my eyes and mind.

Likewise, I couldn't live in Singapore anymore because I couldn't bear the conversations anymore and the insular way of thinking. My health has also improved, friends say I look younger, and I have a lot more time to dive into hobbies now, even if they don't make me money. I can do them, just because. Stuff like learning to draw, learning another language, surfing etc. The downsides are like you said - you have to face the real questions in life without the distractions of work - what is the real meaning and purpose of life etc.

I'm glad you made the move - Congratulations. I wish you and your family all the best!

I'm happy to connect anytime!"
"Thanks for sharing! As someone who has been on a career break for 1.5 years, I resonated with this post a lot. I agree that the stress of life continues and it doesn’t go away with not working. I constantly wonder if I will have enough money if I should just FIRE now. 

However, I treasure my current life so much and it’s so difficult for my friends to understand why I chose this lifestyle. Having like minded people around helps."
"Thank you for your sharing. The content was sincere and relatable. The pros and cons are very real. I have made preparations to kick-start my FIRE journey,  and  I'm ready for it to be executed soon with God's blessings and timing.

I like your sharing about structured and unstructured time, gave yourself time to settle down with the change, disconnect from corporate life, regain back your sense of purpose in this life to do the things meaningful to you and your family. 

I agree with your comments about many people talked about FIRE but few actually do it in Singapore. Some I know, worry about their finances, and if their savings could sustain their current  lifestyle. They were some survey and statistics generated recently,  in order to retire comfortably, needs about 1.3M. I'm not sure if this 1.3M was including or excluding CPF savings. Having said this, most people in Singapore if possible to continue working until 63 or more and looking forward to CPF Life payout. Those below retirement age of 63, would think twice because of the loss of regular income. And most people may not have another source of income e.g equities investment and dividends, income from options premiums, real estate rental, any side hustle that generates some income, either passive or active. 

It is of very great importance for anyone who wants to consider FIRE to know how to generate another or more source of income other than their salary. 

It was very encouraging to read your post and indeed a great achievement for you to FIRE below 40! Great job! 

As for me, I am not reaching retirement age anytime near. My first pit stop will be at 55, and I'm looking forward to this life journey without the worries of corporate life and night calls. My focus will be similar to yours, finding time for activities that will bring more meaning to me in this life, and for me to be involved in community work, church ministry and services. I read and know about many people who stopped working without a plan, and most want to travel and go on holidays. It is not possible to travel and go on holidays 365 days/year, maybe once every quarter it's possible with some personal objectives. In my opinion, it is equally important for anyone who plans to FIRE, to plan the activities  to fill time with focus and meaning, or else boredom will start to kick in, and many had health problems afterwards, mental illness such as depression and anxiety disorder etc
Many I know had gone back to work because they cannot sustain the unstructured time, and lack of interactions with collegues had caused them to be isolated. So it is important to have friends outside work, and to have strong connection with immediate family members ie spouse, children, parents, siblings, pets etc.

In my opinion, FIRE is not a solo endeavor but requires support and accountability. If anyone who wants to FIRE and has not considered the complexity that comes with it, the journey is going to be short-lived and disastrous.

Thank you again for sharing and all the best in this journey.
I will be checking out this space for more of your write-up and insightful sharing."
"Hey, good job. I'm a little bit in a different boat (I actually generally enjoy working, and would be way too scared to lose money trading options if I had no failsafe), but it sure is inspiring to read."
"Actually living life, congrats!!

I'm wondering, are you inherently interested in trading and the stock market? Or is this something that you had to force yourself to do? How do you find the energy to not just chill after work, but actively learn and do trading?"
"I am 39, annual expenses at \~72k SGD. 

Portfolio allocation wise - thematic long on commodities due to inflationary story. Can't share too much here as this is my trading edge. As for withdrawal strategy, 4% target rate. Tactically, I withdraw every month on my IBKR account to fit cash flow needs. 

I write in my substack now. Used to have a paid hosting account but don't see a need to pay to write =)"
"Great question. 

Well if a golden goose came to your house and started laying golden eggs, what would you do? Call a press conference? 

I've received tons of PMs related to this. The answer is no for now. I've spent years developing my trading edge, and teaching it broadly does not make sense. Even if I do, it will be priced at a nonsensical price that it would make sense for me. 

that said, the techniques/tactics/methods are all free to learn over the internet/youtube and the fake financial gurus peddle them everywhere. What no one can teach is the actual trading execution, trade management, risk management and psychology + knowledge of the underlying asset on how/why they behave the way they do."
I budget annual expenses at \~72000 SGD/year. Track all my expenses through an app MoneyManager.  Withdraw from IBKR monthly for cashflow/bills.
"great question. am curious to know what is your definition of ego and how does it suit your purpose in life. 

If it means a certain status tied to your job or earning power - it is great while you have it, but watch for the tradeoffs. Most of my peers at my age who are always chasing after the next bigger and shiner things, they look great on the outside, but the tradeoffs become apparent as you probe further. Health, family issues, kid growing up neglected, divorce etc. I was always consciously aware of the tradeoffs I made thru my career, and having a clear eyed view through other's experiences pushed me to FIRE as early asap."
"Shared above in one of the comments. 

If i could do it again, I would spend less on silly things in my younger days and invested more way earlier. I would have been way richer due to the compounding effects of time."
"HDB, mortgage with \~280k SGD left, fully serviceable by CPF but I am not paying it off. 

Yes, i drive too!"
"Exercise/read/groceries in the morning, play games, meal prep for dinner, chores intermittently, play with kid after childcare in the evening, trade at night, sleep. R/simpleliving style :)"
"Hi OP, what kind of flat are you living in? My spouse and I (with a 2YO Kid) is considering whether to upgrade to an EC, or just finish paying current house and build our portfolio towards a FIRE path. We are only 31 and 29 now. You being able to retire at 39 is just wow!!"
"Is this 1.5m in ibkr, or does it include cash, bonds, cpf etc? And also is it joint with your wife, and does the 72k/yr include your whole family's living expense? 

Also, congratulations! Very inspired by your story. I'm 10 years younger, and on track too! Thank you sm for sharing"
Well done! How much time do you spend on trading?
"it really depends right? I know quite a number of cases my friends have to bankroll the kids going to overseas universities because they cannot study/ cope with the Sg system and make it to local universities or get to a desirable course they want like medicine/law here. Also many cases amongs my peers, where even at secondary level, their kids have to go to expensive international schools like ACS Intl because they cannot cope with the rigour and workload of public schools."
"Thanks again for the share and a thoughtful question. I've been running around the past few days and considering it. 

What I've settled on is that ego currently feels like 'a sense of status thanks to my role at work'. There's a small high in being a dependable leader and team player (I work in advertising). The best comparative metaphor is like being in an influential role on a sports team. 

Thinking about it over the long weekend, I guess I could try to find that within another non-work setting after the RE. 

Wishing you a wonderful journey mate. I suppose long weekends are just extra family time now? Hehe"
A resale 4rm HDB.
"YMMV across different FIRED folks. 
I guess it is still early in my FIRE experience - I have yet to explore a trusted circle of influence that I want to spend my time with. Surprising to me, I still spend most of time with my peers who are still working and I enjoy these interactions more if they are like-minded and are on the FIRE journey too."
"Maybe these people have friends and companions from their hobbies? After all, you FIRE to spend more time on things you enjoy. It might not necessarily be something financial related. "
"Yes if the parents choose to do this it will get costly real quick. Don't see this as an issue for me and my wife in the future. That said, both of us were raised in families with no safeguards from our parents, and we take the same view towards our kid. Scarcity drives hunger, I want my kid to be driven"
"I get you, totally! Had the same experience, it feels great to be needed. Had my career highlights leading global teams and projects that drove billions of revenues and costs, realising long term strategic priorities and the glory that comes with it (comp, bonuses, the celebration off sites, business class travels  etc), it's hard to picture an alternative option that would beat this. 

My view is that if this tickles your juice, keep doing it! 

These turned me on for years until they didn't. So I became curious and reflected on why :) 

I still miss leading a team though, it's great to be paid to be a coach plus having people execute your vision :)"
"Higher. Groceries are high, petrol is high, rent is high, tax is high, salary similar, so you'll barely save, or not have any savings"
"Do a post tax comparison - income, capital gain, property/council, gst/vat etc"
"Can't speak for Ireland but I was in Frankfurt for some years before moving to SG.  Frankfurt has similar salaries to Dublin but with a lower COL. I went to Dublin a few times and found prices for eating and drinking to be almost comparable to NYC which is probably 30-40% more than Frankfurt. Rents were also more expensive along with almost everything else. Pint of Guinness was about the only affordable thing there. I honestly didn't understand how anyone could afford life in Dublin.

I moved from Frankfurt to SG with my P2, I didn't work because I am already FIRE'd but she is not. Her net salary doubled. Same job, same position, same title, same everything. Double the net salary. Cost of living is definitely higher in SG but with double the net salary, the ability to save money goes through the roof.

I woudl say SG and Dublin are probably about comparable with COL with slightly lower rents in Dublin. Dublin has no cheap hawker food thoguh so keep that in mind. SG is generally cheaper than NYC from rent and food/drinks point of view. Of course, carownership is more expensive in SG but no one needs a car in SG. it's only for vanity."
According to numbeo cost of living in singapore is 21.1% higher than Ireland. But if you're an expat you'll probably make more so it's fine.
what about the cost of living
"I lived in Ireland 2014-2019, Singapore is somewhat better and I moved back mainly because of the familiarity. If you were Irish you might feel Ireland is better because of subjective familiarity. 


Specifically related to cost of living to answer OP’s question - Ireland is much cheaper. Only issue is you don’t have the cheap option of hawker centre but then again you shouldn’t be eating that everyday. 
If you cook at home - groceries are fresher and cost much less at stores like Tesco. Esp local poultry and veggies, milk, anything that goes through the local supply chain even Ben and Jerry’s - half the price vs sg. 
2L milk there €1.69, vs Meiji here $6.95
1kg Chicken leg there €3, here $12.80 

Eating at restaurants in Ireland vs Singapore. Actually menu prices in Ireland are marginally lower if you compare like for like, but theirs is nett pricing. Drinks are also cheaper. So in the end dining in sg is probably 30-40% more ex vs Ireland. 

Rent: prices have gone up there and locals are complaining, but for a 4000+ sq ft landed 5 BR house I rented in the equivalent of Bt Timah over in Dublin it was €4500 per month, you just compare to how much the same house would cost here. Easily $18000. 

Cars: we have the most expensive cars in the world. 

Taxes: yes theirs are higher"
